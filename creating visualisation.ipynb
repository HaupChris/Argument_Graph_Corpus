      "this will mean they will not <br> actually be receiving that higher pay <br> as it will go back into <br> repaying their student loan . they <br> could as easily go for a <br> lower paid job outside their relevant <br> degree just to avoid repaying the <br> debt .\n",

      "it appears to be unfair as <br> some individuals ( higher earning jobs <br> ) will have to pay a <br> large amount off whereas other individuals <br> ( below the threshold ) may <br> have obtained a free education\n",
