1,CA4A1,A44CA4,"This entirely depends on the industry and type of job. For a job that requires a degree, work ethics and experience will not be enough."
2,CA4A2,A44CA4,A degree is necessary to use as a tool to differentiate between candidates
3,CA4A3,A44CA4,Not everyone has the money to do further education therefore the fees should be abolished
4,CA4A4,A44CA4,A degree is important not only only for the better job perspectives but also for self confidence. The employer would hire someone with the High job ethics and experience AND the academic knowledge will  
5,CA4A5,A44CA4,A degree is important as it demonstrates self discipline and a desire to self improve. 
6,CA4A6,A44CA4,"Nowadays many companies complain about lack of talents; they become less competitive and their performance is not so good as they expect. All because they lack talented employees. At the same time, many talented young people can not develop their skills and gain knowledge, because they are too poor to pay for the education. Wouldn't that be beneficial for companies and future young specialists, if the fees decrease?"
7,CA4A7,A44CA4,"University studies do not just provide a degree, people get trained to critically think. "
8,CA4A8,A44CA4,Work experience can also be gained by studying at university as there are courses which involve a year in industry. Work ethics are also acquired by taking part in group projects at university. 
9,CA4A9,A44CA4,With a degree you are able to expand on this work experience and if you have the opportunity to study for a degree and further your education you will stand a better chance when competing for jobs
10,CA4A10,A44CA4,Taking your point that degrees may not be necessary there are still other costs to prevent people taking their course too lightly. A financial deterrence shouldn't be one of them.
11,CA2A1,A60CA2,In other countries (like Germany) universities are free but the taxes are not necessarily much higher.
12,CA2A2,A60CA2,More likely to get jobs that earn decent wages and start contributing via Tax and NI
13,CA2A3,A60CA2,The government spends money on other things like weapons and wars  but they should think of the people in UK 
14,CA2A4,A60CA2,By offering more diverse opportunities the Government will gain more highly qualified workers
15,CA2A5,A60CA2,"In Scotland, tertiary education is free, and nobody complains about how it is funded. "
16,CA2A6,A60CA2,"Well, our economy will benefit from getting more young talents involved, so the level of UK citizens' life will grow"
17,CA2A7,A60CA2,we pay enough taxes  but not all pay what they should. Make the tax dodgers to pay what they should.
18,CA2A8,A60CA2,"It is better for taxes to go towards important causes such as higher education, than it is for them to go to people falsely claiming benefits"
19,CA2A9,A60CA2,Other things could be implented into the university to raise money for the university therefore limiting the effect on taxes
20,CA2A10,A60CA2,"Not necessarily if universities are encouraged to become more self funding, i.e through renting out facilities/accomadation when not in use or use the minds of student to solve commercial problems. Like a human equivalent of renting super computer time."
21,CA4bA1,A18CA4,The student loan interest rates are quite high and students end up repaying much more than they initially borrowed. 
22,CA4bA2,A18CA4,Financial education is lacking to assume that uni age students can deal with the debt efficiently 
23,CA4bA3,A18CA4,Not many students are able to pay back the loan 
24,CA4bA4,A18CA4,"The banks are earning money on providing loans to students and they will not work without gaining profit from the loans. Students still need to repay a massive amount of money, when they could actually step on the property ladder earlier"
25,CA4bA5,A18CA4,"It's ridiculous to saddle young people with lifelong debt because they want to be educated. Education should not see employment (and the ability to repay a loan) as the end goal, but rather as a human right. "
26,CA4bA6,A18CA4,Student loans and high fees still make education less appealing for the prospective students
27,CA4bA7,A18CA4,With future uncertainty becoming the rule young people from low income families will not want this heavy loan burden. So back to the rich getting educated and the poor ........................
28,CA4bA8,A18CA4,"Loans still have to be paid back. As soon as the graduate starts earning enough, the banks take a huge proportion of their salary"
29,CA4bA9,A18CA4,Students who come from less wealthy backgrounds will feel at a disadvantage and may be less likely to attend uni because of the fees. All inidividuals should be able to attend university regardless of their parents financial situation
30,CA4bA10,A18CA4,"Even with this, students can be naive and misspend the maintenance loans given to them. Wasting government resources that could be spent elsewhere, where it would be more efficiently spent."
31,CA1A1,A11CA1,But what if someone really wants to be an engineer? Then this person should be able to go to university
32,CA1A2,A11CA1,easier to get education now rather than later in life
33,CA1A3,A11CA1,Everyone should have the right to an education bcoz so many don't have the money to pay fees so they loose out and they have the potential to study and become something 
34,CA1A4,A11CA1,"University do not only provide doctors and engineers degrees, there are plenty of other possibilities and fields to grow. Each area need their own highly knowledgeable and qualified staff. The degree should be a choice which do not depend on the finances."
35,CA1A5,A11CA1,"Education is about far more than being an engineer: it's about lifeliong learning, confidence, self worth... "
36,CA1A6,A11CA1,It's talent and ability to work hard what makes a person a good doctor or engineer. Money only can not make you a nice specialist
37,CA1A7,A11CA1,"Every job is becoming more and more specialized, further education does not produce only doctors and engineers, it also trains minds"
38,CA1A8,A11CA1,But why should somebodyâ€™s background stop them from pursuing any career. A poor person can be just as good a medic as a rich person. 
39,CA1A9,A11CA1,There are however you are essentially saying that not everyone can be a doctor or engineer only people from a wealthy background can have these careers. Whereas a student from a less wealthy background may be fantastic and be able to creat a cure for cancer but because their parents arent wealthy they never recieve the training
40,CA1A10,A11CA1,"The decision for what career path a young person can take should not be inhibited by whether it can be afforded or not. The government should help enable anyone to thrive in whatever educational path they choose, else this country could be denied great talent put off by the high cost of entry to university."
41,CA6A1,A53CA6,NAN
42,CA6A2,A53CA6,Value for money from the courses available can be questionable if all university's  charge the same amount 
43,CA6A3,A53CA6,9k is very hard to get and also to pay student loan back can be difficult if they don't a good pay job 
44,CA6A4,A53CA6,"Of course Universities need financial support too, it is a Government affair and support. When individuals decide to go to University, they hope to get high paid jobs,"
45,CA6A5,A53CA6,The prospect of having to pay back a loan once a certain level of income is reached may put young people off applying for jobs which will lead to a well paid career. 
46,CA6A6,A53CA6,Many talented young people still won't be able to afford it
47,CA6A7,A53CA6,"Your argument is rubish. The high loan burden affects people in many other ways, i.e mortgages, start business loans, etc."
48,CA6A8,A53CA6,"Those with a masters will be at the level of repayment very quickly, and will then be worse off because theyâ€™ve continued their education "
49,CA6A9,A53CA6,Are the fees ever actually paid back. You have students who dont care about further education still going. 
50,CA6A10,A53CA6,"Given that many graduates don't get close to paying off their loans before the write off date, leaves the burden of funding universities to those who end up in careers that happen to pay well. This is too asymmetric a system that disadvantages and puts off some from pursuing high income careers."
51,,A44CA18,Taking out a loan is not something that students should have to do to go to university as there is no guarantee they will be able to pay it off afterwards.
52,,A44CA18,"Many people struggle to finance their lives as it is. Being poor should not be a barrier to education. For many folk, an extra loan is just not possible."
53,,A44CA18,Many potential university students would still find it affordable and therefore would not take a loan.
54,,A44CA18,We are not talking about Â£500 loan. Not many professionals would be eligible for the such amount to borrow.
55,,A44CA18,"Some people may not be in a position to find funds for uni fees, they may have other financial responsibilities"
56,,A44CA18,i agree with B2
57,,A44CA18,"Determination alone is not enough to provide finances needed to attend university. Without the educational experience needed to find a stable job, how can underprivileged students raise the funds to attend university?"
58,,A44CA18,Burdening students with a large amount of debt is bad for personal finances across the country and bad for the economy in the long term.
59,,A44CA18,The fees are their current level are too high and will put students off. Lower fees would attract more students.
60,,A44CA18,yes but it still puts a lot of pressure on students. Especially non-stem. They do not use any expensive equipment and should be able to enjoy studying just for the sake of it (even if they wont use their degree)
61,,A60CA8,"Not everyone is entitled to these loans, especially the international students who would create diversity."
62,,A60CA8,Not everybody is able or willing to take a student loan. See previous argument. 
63,,A60CA8,Diversity in the student population means a more wider amount of people get a university education that will benefit society.
64,,A60CA8,The student loans still need to be repaid. 
65,,A60CA8,"Some people may just go to university for the ""lifestyle"" i.e. partying etc. If they have to pay themselves there more likely to manage lifestyle choices better"
66,,A60CA8,Free education can be taken for granted if its made free
67,,A60CA8,He problem is that there isnâ€™t an equal opportunity to finance education through student loans. Those in less fortunate financial situations will still be far less inclined to take out loans.
68,,A60CA8,"Diversity is an aim amongst all areas of society, and increasing the diversity will help to increase diversity in general, especially if it removes significant barriers for underprivileged people to attend university."
69,,A60CA8,There is equal opportunity but not always equal ability. Those from less privileged backgrounds might not be educated to know about funding or their parents might not be able to complete the application forms to get the students the means based funding.
70,,A60CA8,Many teenagers whose parents did not go to uni and never took a loan might be talked out by their parents
71,,A18CA6,Students who have only just become legal adults should not have to take out a loan or get themselves into debt just to go to university as it is likely that at that age they will not understand the consequences of a loan.
72,,A18CA6,"Students could find themselves deliberately only accepting low paid jobs, in order to avoid paying back the loan. If money is tight and their salary only just means they have to repay the loan, that might be a debt too far. "
73,,A18CA6,It is still good for students to be forced to have to pay back a large loan even when they are earning enough to repay the amount.
74,,A18CA6,"The aim of the University degree is to get high paid jobs, therefore the they income will exceed a certain level"
75,,A18CA6,"If they dont learn financial responsibility at university, this may lead to debt in later life, i.e. being given money without having to work for it "
76,,A18CA6,There is always education loan which is at very low interest rate and gives plenty of time for repaying and currently it can get waived off as well if student cannot afford even after graduating adutating 
77,,A18CA6,"Students in less stable financial situations will may be concerned about exceeding that income in the future, dissuading them from taking out a loan in the first place."
78,,A18CA6,"Student loans only cover so much and only start after studying, you still need to put up a not insignificant amount of money to get going. And paying back the loans amounts to, in effect, a 9% tax on graduates."
79,,A18CA6,"They still have to have the money available to pay for living expenses and accommodation. Some students are not able to get the maintenance loan due to their parents income, yet their parents cannot spare the money to support them."
80,,A18CA6,"Apart from the loan for the fees, students will also somehow have to cover living costs which just adds up to the money they will have to repay later or work alongside uni"
81,,A11CA5,"There are other options available, free education would not automatically require raised taxes."
82,,A11CA5,"As noted in previous questionnaire, it's not an issue in Scotland, where university education is already free and nobody complains about it. "
83,,A11CA5,The more people in society from less privileged backgrounds who are able to attend university is good for society and therefore desirable.
84,,A11CA5,"It is not about all getting University degree, it is about being available for all, so everyone has an equal opportunity"
85,,A11CA5,"In that case, then students should pay for primary and secondary school, learning is a human right"
86,,A11CA5,Agree with A2 as it government cannot afford free education for all hence why we have scholarships which can be used by the students who really good at there studies rather being mis used by all students 
87,,A11CA5,An increase in taxes is unnecessary. A redistribution of government funding is a more feasible solution.
88,,A11CA5,University was free for a long time as it was generally accepted to be a worthy investment in the country's future. Graduates free of debt have more income to place back into the economy.
89,,A11CA5,"The government are still paying for the loans and probably won't see the money back when the loans are written off in 30 years time. Cheaper education and higher taxes is more sustainable than relying on students to pay back the loans, which they won't."
90,,A11CA5,In other countries it seems to work without taxes being significantly higher than in the UK
91,,A53CA8,"Whilst there are more people attending, there are also more who find university doesnâ€™t help them and they are then in debt as a result. If it were free this would not be a problem."
92,,A53CA8,The standard of education and available degrees has fallen. Getting a degree is very easy now. 
93,,A53CA8,Most students still come from weathier backgrounds and those who cannot afford it are still not finding it accessible to attain higher education degrees.
94,,A53CA8,"Population grow, so grow the amount of people going to University. Also, a lot of universities  have they outreach staff, who promotes higher education in the wider community.However there are still a lot of people, who  are still not aware that University is an option for them"
95,,A53CA8,Some people get in debt whilst at uni as they are unable to survive living costs due to low student low and drop out without completing their course
96,,A53CA8,Education is taken seriously now which is essential in life and has become a vital task in life 
97,,A53CA8,You canâ€™t wholly attribute the rise in university attendees to the cost of education. There are many other economical and social factors at work.
98,,A53CA8,"More people go now because the developed world is extending its record peacetime stretch and so the focus can be on educating more people, so more people go because more places become available, not because of tuition fees."
99,,A53CA8,"It is more widely accessible, but there is also a greater financial burden than ever before."
100,,A53CA8,Yes but that is because there are more universities and more people than in the past. people also have more personal debt than ever before
101,,A44CA19,NAN
102,,A44CA19,Everyone should have the opportunity to do further education if they wish to 
103,,A44CA19,How can we expect to have world class leaders and researchers if most people cant 
104,,A44CA19,"University fees cost a lot, especially for students who are just starting out. "
105,,A44CA19,"People should only be encouraged to go to university if they are academically able. It should be based on brains, not finances. "
106,,A44CA19,This creates and encourages a social lottery whereby those who are born into an affluent family are more forthnate
107,,A44CA19,Many types of career require university educated students and so the more people who are able to gain a degree is good for society.
108,,A44CA19,"Some students will never afford to pay back the loans, as a lot of degrees do not result in a high paying job at the end."
109,,A44CA19,Education is used to develop a students skills and knowledge as well as their research and presentation skills. These skills are transferable to the world of work in many industries. We require a population of educated people ot drive forwards innovation to create jobs and security.
110,,A44CA19,NAN
111,,A60CA9,"People from lower classes would be put off by these costs, whereas if there were no fees, they would feel more comfortable achieving a place and more willing to attend"
112,,A60CA9,Some people really want to do a degree but not able to bcoz of the very high fees 
113,,A60CA9,People most of the time dont pay it back fully and the interest is too high to make a reasonable dent so it is also hurting government funding
114,,A60CA9,Many students have issues taking out loans and just donâ€™t have the money to pay the extortionate fees. 
115,,A60CA9,Poor students will be afraid to take on perhaps even more debt. See my answer in previous questionnaire. 
116,,A60CA9,For some people they cannot afford to actually live at university and cover costs without a bigger grant or without financial support. Lumbering students with debts for the rest of their lives who already acrue debts is just unfair 
117,,A60CA9,If those people who are from less weathy backgrounds are deterred from taking tuition fees due to high costs then that is not good for the university system in this country.
118,,A60CA9,Young people from poorer backgrounds may have less financial backing and are unable to take on the large cost of doing a degree
119,,A60CA9,Whilst true that a person would pay to pursue their chosen field of study they may not wish to take on the financial responsibility for a loan as they do not have the level of debt tollerance required for this. They may also come from societies that will not accept the loans as they use interest payments making htem incorrect to use under the religious beliefs. Other education routes that are none degree can lead to the same outcomes at lower cost to the student or country.
120,,A60CA9,It is very difficult to tell what you want at 18. People should have the opportunity to try out different things without risking of losing thousands of pounds
121,,A18CA19,"But you also have an overdraft that most students end up going into, and also student loans are dependant on the financial income of their home, not everyone is entitled."
122,,A18CA19,Even students loans are difficult to pay back not everyone gets a good paid job 
123,,A18CA19,If the student cant pay it back it adds more and more stress to the student
124,,A18CA19,"Student need to save their money for other issues surrounding university such as accommodation, bills and food. "
125,,A18CA19,People shouldn't feel they can't apply for better paid jobs because they're afraid of having to pay back a huge debt. 
126,,A18CA19,What is the point in this then. If the government is never going to get the money back they are getting themselves into debt by lending it 
127,,A18CA19,Forcing university students into the financial burden of a tuition loan will not encourage more people to apply to university and so therefore is a bad idea in general.
128,,A18CA19,The large interest rates associated with student loans mean that students will be paying loans back their entire working life
129,,A18CA19,The student loan is not a pay it back when you can. IT is pay it back when your income goes above a certain level. This level can be changed by governments without recourse to current borrowers. It takes no account of how affordable the repayments are to the individual on a person by person basis. One person could be unencumbered by a family and another have a family of 5. They could have the same income but their expenditure would be much higher. This is not taken into account.
130,,A18CA19,Interest rates are very high and the high fees discourage students from trying out different things. They might get stuck in a degree they don't like but feel they need to finish
131,,A11CA10,"By not making university readily available for everyone, we're not giving everyone a fair chance, people from poorer backgrounds or live in certain locations don't even think about uni because they don't understand the way uni pricings work, they just think they need to pay ridiculous amounts of money and are forever in debt if they want to go to uni, so never even entertain the thought."
132,,A11CA10,Maybe reduce the income of the royal family and help students get their  education 
133,,A11CA10,The fear of the cost is preventing many people from getting degrees
134,,A11CA10,Students should be able to focus on their university course without worrying about having to pay back a student loan. 
135,,A11CA10,There's nothing wrong with taxing society in order to educate society. 
136,,A11CA10,Interest is added on and this added debt until you earn a certain amount still puts pressure on young people 
137,,A11CA10,Further taxation is used to fund good university education for a wider amount of people would still be a more better method.
138,,A11CA10,Maintenance loans given to students are often not enough for students to live on without help from family also
139,,A11CA10,"I think that education should be for everyone ad be free. The university fees are inflated to whatever the government sets no matter what the reputation of the university or the course of study. Better to remove the artificial barrier and let market forces dictate the cost of the courses. By using a tax on everyone this artificail barrier is removed. Accusations could, of course, be levelled that this would make a degree at better perceived institutions more open to those with capital than those without thus making them only for the elite."
140,,A11CA10,Other countries like Germany someone manage to have a fair tax system and free and excellent education
141,,A53CA13,"By making it up to the state, people aren't getting a fair chance, if you're in one location why should you get different rules, it would make one uni in a location have no applicants"
142,,A53CA13,Yes state should help in educating people to higher levels 
143,,A53CA13,"The amount of student finance you get is not right for the amount the courses cost, most people simply cannot afford accomodation etc with that allowance"
144,,A53CA13,Some families are from a poor background and would struggle to pay the university fees or get a loan. 
145,,A53CA13,I'm not sure what this statement means. 
146,,A53CA13,Some people need to get another qualification to pursue their dream career. Why should they be unable to pursue this because they are not wealthy 
147,,A53CA13,Graduates will not find it desirable to take on such a large financial burden and as such will most likely deter other people from doing the same.
148,,A53CA13,There should be greater help available for those from disadvantaged backgrounds to encourage more involvement in higher education
149,,A53CA13,"This question ties all education to that of a tiny profession with arcane rules of progression. In this situation then, based on the assumption that they would not be paid for the internship, they would need to borrow. In any profession that requires an internship the student must be given access to funds based on a needs assessment. Alternatively, as in teaching, the student needs to be paid for the internship by the organisation employing them, i.e. chambers. This can then be recovered later for the student upon their successful completion of the internship and entry into employment. "
150,,A53CA13,NAN
151,,A68CA9,This can be circumvented with entry requirements and exams (like is happening at this moment). Money does not decide whether someone has the skills or not 
152,,A68CA9,"Equally, someone may have the skills and talent but not the funding to get the qualifications and education, limiting the success they achieve during their life."
153,,A68CA9,"Given the right tools, support and motivation, most people are capable of great things. They will gain the skills if they have these things. "
154,,A68CA9,"Noone has the right to deny someone the opportunity to pursue a career that they want. Qualification as a doctor is due to academic success, which is not due to whether or not you can afford to pay tuition fees - you are giving access to the qualification, not deciding whether or not they can qualify. "
155,,A68CA9,"Student fees help to weed out the people that aren't really into the course. If it was cheap or for free "" what have you got to lose?"" "
156,,A68CA9,"If they did not have the required skills, they would not pass the course."
157,,A68CA9,I agree with a2
158,,A68CA9,We do not want to end up with a society where lower class people are kept doing menial work for low pay through generations. What if Stephen Hawkin was unable to attend university and his superior intelligence was never shared with the world. If we assume that only the well off deserve to be given the opportunity to continue their learning the we are all the poorer for it.
159,,A68CA9,The UCAS system will be in place to ensure that students are getting the correct grades to be able to get onto the course.
160,,A68CA9,High school diplomas and entry exams determine that. not fees.
161,,A1CA3,The government could cut down on prestige projects and arms and invest them into higher education instead
162,,A1CA3,More people may go to university if the fees are lower and less daunting.
163,,A1CA3,"Everyone in society benefits from education- the social benefits of having trained doctors, teachers etc far out weights the cost of taxes. "
164,,A1CA3,But we pay for many things with our taxes that some of us won't access. What about the people who have children and those that don't? Do we need to have special criteria for each person as to which taxes they spend? No - we all contibute to provide access for all. Education helps us to better society and it should be able to be accessed by all.
165,,A1CA3,"Taxes will always be what they are. If something drops off., something else will take its place. When have you ever known taxes to go down? "
166,,A1CA3,Some of it should be paid through taxes and some by the student.
167,,A1CA3,Burserys should be made available for more job subjects
168,,A1CA3,Taxes are not a shared pot only there to cover a persons presumed future needs. Taxes are a duty of a democratic society to help our fellow man. If we start limiting access to services based on contributions or the assumption of our not needing to use them then we inch slowly toward a world we only get help if you can pay for it in advance. I might never need to call an ambulance but I am glad I know I can if I need to and would never hesitate simply because I might not be able to pay the cost afterwards.
169,,A1CA3,"But I think it will encourage more people to attend university also many people pay for services through their taxes which they don't use, so I don't see how it's unfair "
170,,A1CA3,A lot of universities make profit too. Those profits could be used to lower the fees. The government would not have to fund everything
171,,A23CA8,"There are countries where university is entirely free. 9k is a high amount, not to mention the interest rate on the student loans. Universities, even if not free, should be at least cheaper"
172,,A23CA8,"Many jobs and well-paying careers require a university education , it is extremely competitive to get a job that would pay enough to alleviate university costs. "
173,,A23CA8,Under privileged students from low socio economic backgrounds will live in poverty forever even with a degree if they have to pay fees. They will he put off going even if they are the brightest student. 
174,,A23CA8,"There is no guarantee that you will get a job after your degree. The student loan does take a significant percentage from your monthly wage slip, which doesn't seem fair."
175,,A23CA8,As far as I understand you only have to pay back the money if you earn over a certain amount so ppl who cannot afford it are not expected to. 
176,,A23CA8,It is difficult for some graduates to find a well-paid job and the debt is too great.
177,,A23CA8,Fees should be relevant to the job wage you are training for
178,,A23CA8,Degrees no longer hold the same importance they once did and there is no guarantee a job will be there. A lifetime of debt hanging over someone is a heavy burden and recent stories of how young people have had their student loans badly managed or fraudulently handled highlight how little protections are in place for these people.
179,,A23CA8,"But they are not, Especially students who are entering creative fields there is not as much money placed into theses industries, and the government does not place as much funding into these courses"
180,,A23CA8,NAN
181,,A11CA17,"online platforms do not replace a university degree. Yes, you may learn just as much but a lot of employers want to see that piece of paper (diploma)"
182,,A11CA17,Scholarships are extremely difficult to get and are not always given without bias; online and cheap educations are sometimes looked down upon by employers than education from prestigious universities. 
183,,A11CA17,"True, letâ€™s make a system where people can learn and gain university qualifications whilst in the workplace. "
184,,A11CA17,"Online platforms are not as beneficial as face to face education - and what happens if the internet goes down or you miss a course announcement? University is also about the experience of moving away from home for the first time - it's about personal and social development, as well as academic. "
185,,A11CA17,That's what student loans are for. If you are on low income. You can get the loan. Finsh the course. Get a good paying job off the back of it and then be in a position to pay back the loan
186,,A11CA17,Universities provide the best higher education and there are not enough scholarships available for all talented students.
187,,A11CA17,Unfortunately apprenticeships aren't viable for everyone as they need to be able to afford to live and they pay less than it costs to live
188,,A11CA17,"These online platforms are not accessible to everyone (eg the disabled, underprivileged or homeless) scholarships should be there to help the best and brightest gain access to the top universities or specialists colleges overseas. They should not be the only channel for the most ignored people in our society to gain access to learning and growing."
189,,A11CA17,"But these platforms are very rarely offering an actual degree qualification. There is very little support for student trying to apply for scholarships at school, adn what do they do if they don't get it? This also bars students who are not seen as 
'talented' but the current education system.   "
190,,A11CA17,But certain professions require a university diploma. University is often not just about knowledge but about getting that piece of paper
191,,A66CA3,The interest rates are high and puts pressure on the student to find a highly paid job as fast as possible after graduating. 
192,,A66CA3,Prospective students who have family relying on them to be the main provider often cannot afford to take out a loan and can find it difficult to find a job that can support both their education and other needs and responsibilities.  
193,,A66CA3,Equality and fairness in a university student sample isnâ€™t there. Students from lower incomes just arenâ€™t represented- something puts them off. Possibly fees. 
194,,A66CA3,You should not have to take out a loan to access an education. There is a generation of renters instead of home owners now due to the fact they can't save enough to have a deposit - how is adding more debt to them going to help them get on the housing market? And how can you afford to pay back a mortgage if you don't have a good job? 
195,,A66CA3,In this world you only get what you are willing to put the work in for. If you put the energy and time in you can get what ever you want. 
196,,A66CA3,It is not as easy now to find a good job and there are too many graduates.
197,,A66CA3,"Unfortunately it isn't available to everyone when I wanted to study veterinary medicine at 17 a burserys wasn't available for that subject and no one would give a 17 year old with no credit rating a loan for over 12,000 pounds "
198,,A66CA3,"It may not be impossible but it is far too difficult for the people who already have so little that to ask them to find the means to borrow so much money for the student fees then also find a way to pay to live, many end up not even bothering to apply. Some of those that do end up having to sacrifice their time between working and learning that they end up disadvantaged against those who donâ€™t have to work and perpetuating the social imbalance."
199,,A66CA3,"Firstly it is very hard to juggle having a full time education with a job, and these loans have high interests rates which is essentially exploiting these kids because they don't typically have any other options.   "
200,,A66CA3,NAN
201,,A68CA16,fees should be written off when they find a job so they do not have a debt hanging over thier head
202,,A68CA16,Large fees may put young people off the idea of attending university
203,,A68CA16,Many graduate level jobs are very low pay and so the burden of student loan debt may be too much of a struggle for them to cope with even though they are in employment. This can lead to a debt problem at the very start of their career which escalates over time and can result in a life-long issue with debt
204,,A68CA16,"The loan still need to be paid. Once the job secured, it is natural would be to go on the property ladder, but student loan has to come first!"
205,,A68CA16,"Fees are not fair to people that live in poverty, Everyone should be entitied to free education."
206,,A68CA16,It would depend on how long a repayment period there is 
207,,A68CA16,Loans usually leave the student indebted for a long time 
208,,A68CA16,"So if people had bad credit scores, or didn't have the ability to access this loan, this would basically affect their chance to get a well paid job? "
209,,A68CA16,I believe in free education for all 
210,,A68CA16,It is still a loan. Young people should be worried about their debt at such an early stage
211,,A1CA4,giving free education opens the door for everyone to better themselves
212,,A1CA4,People are unlikely to willingly give up three years of their life just because university is free.
213,,A1CA4,"The introduction of university fees in the UK has demonstrated that the opposite has happened, standards have actually dropped in the past few decades which is evidenced by the existence of grade erosion. By paying for their university education students have been transformed into customers who feel they have an entitlement to a high grade simply because they have paid for it"
214,,A1CA4,Free education would offer more opportunities to underprivileged and increase the quality of life and services. More competition would cause more ambitions to learn.
215,,A1CA4,Some people would not be able to access university due to their financial circumstances.
216,,A1CA4,"Instead of making it free, make it a more affordable to those who want it"
217,,A1CA4,Free university could possibly increase the number of small businesses in the country
218,,A1CA4,"On the other hand it would enrich many peoples lives, many people who go on to have poorly paid jobs and bad life choices would be able to avoid that completely. "
219,,A1CA4,NAN
220,,A1CA4,"Education is not a waste, everyone should be able to attend University ."
221,,A23CA12,NAN
222,,A23CA12,I agree
223,,A23CA12,It's unfair to treat students differently by means testing whether or not they should repay their loans without any assistance.
224,,A23CA12,That's why the fees should be abolished or significantly reduced.
225,,A23CA12,"Going into adulthood with a lot of debt will not be good, and is not fair "
226,,A23CA12,The repayment should be a low percentage of their earnings
227,,A23CA12,They must know and be given sufficient advice and possible job opportunities before starting their degree
228,,A23CA12,"It should have nothing to do with earnings, debt is debt and no one should be made to enter it just for education "
229,,A23CA12,NAN
230,,A23CA12,No students should be worried about their debts at such an early age
231,,A11CA23,Students should be able to pay the loan back over their lifetime
232,,A11CA23,Not every student will be in a financial position to pay it back and will have the burden of a loan hanging over them well into adulthood
233,,A11CA23,"""Affordable"" and ""reasonable"" mean different things to different people and what might be affordable for one person would be onerous for another"
234,,A11CA23,There is not about information and promotion about the student loan being affordable for everyone. It is also has to be mention the support of the student whilst studying and getting degree.
235,,A11CA23,NaN 
236,,A11CA23,I agree with this wholeheartedly
237,,A11CA23,Everyone canâ€™t afford loans and end up defaulting on the loan or pay it back over an extreme amount of time as they didnâ€™t get the job they thought theyâ€™d get
238,,A11CA23,Some people would not be able to access these student loans and again this gets them into debt. 
239,,A11CA23,NAN
240,,A11CA23,Loans should be avoided at such a young age
241,,A66CA7,if students are paying for their education they will work harder to achieve their full potential 
242,,A66CA7,Scholarships are often only available to the privileged few
243,,A66CA7,There may be more exceptional students than there are scholarship opportunities and so capable students will miss out because of the competition for funding
244,,A66CA7,It is has been proved by the researchers that those who stand out have more financial opportunities to do so.
245,,A66CA7,"Why should only rich people have access to this education, this is putting a big divide in society "
246,,A66CA7,Exceptional students should be treated the same as everyone else
247,,A66CA7,NAN
248,,A66CA7,No. Its vulnerable people who would not normally consider university that should also get it as it betters lives. 
249,,A66CA7,NAN
250,,A66CA7,Everyone should be able to have free education.
251,,A68CA19,"For many students it is a question of affordability, even if both parents are in full time work."
252,,,"Yes I do agree, however I feel that possibly you pay and then if you get a job in that specialised area, you perhaps get a portion of your student fees wiped. "
253,,,Scholarships should be avaibale for all students - a bit like the American system of a grade point average - if you achieve you get to have free or discounted education.
254,,,I don't know if a sholoarsip would really help all that much in the case of university fees.
255,,,Potential students that are on a lower income may be put off by the high fees applied to university courses. They maybe more likely to access free courses in order  to achieve similar outcomes 
256,,,I think fees should be lower even if universities are going to charge because to study a graduate program for three years and pay each year a sum itâ€™s too much 
257,,,"Despite the fact that fees are not repaid until the individual is earning a set amount is a huge consideration for many and, in many cases, is the fundamental reason for choosing not to go to university."
258,,,Pay compensations for underprivileged backgrounds to give them a chance too
259,,,"The school environment is not the right environment to learn for all individuals - some people learn better in another environment. This would penalise those pupils who would achieve success at university, purely on the basis that they were unable to achieve at school."
260,,,Means testing can be abused and those who should not qualify end up taking money from other students' support. Far better to have an affordable level for all.
261,,A1CA16,Academic education is not just a question of university fees but the ability to live while studying still remains a barrier to many.
262,,,"I do agree, however education is a human right, regardless of price. We are constantly learning in everyday life and do not have to pay. "
263,,,We need educated people in the UK to stop having to 'import' qualified people from elsewhere and therefore we should be educating people such as nurses and other professionals.
264,,,If you choose to return to education at a later date because at age 18 there wasn't anything that was right for you then paying for it shouldn't be a must.
265,,,Education and health should be the great equalisers available to everyone 
266,,,"Some people really havenâ€™t got the money to go to
University even with student loans the debt and interest rate is ridiculous never be able to pay it back especially when you got to earn a certain amount in the first place "
267,,,"It may not be a human right, but on some professions it is a necessity. However, some may not choose a profession because of funding."
268,,,Further education usually leads to better paid jobs 
269,,,"In today's society, most jobs require a certain level of education, and with the introduction of more automated procedures, a lot of work that would normally have been completed by human workers, will no longer take place in 10 to 20 years. Our populis must therefore be educated to compensate for this increase in automation, to ensure that the population remains productive. "
270,,," For some degrees, support should always be given to benefit the economy and society. For example nursing degrees, medicine, and STEM."
271,,A23CA20,the psychological impact of a large dept upon the poorer student undoubtedly deters many from achieving thier full potential.
272,,,"However they aren't earning enough, and just getting into debt and therefore the government is getting into debt because students cannot pay it back. "
273,,,Most students don't end up paying back their student loan and this saddles the country with debt and some students deliberately remain below the payback threshold as they beielve they should have been educated for free and therefore do not want to pay back their loans.
274,,,If for any reason they are not earning enought then they won't be able to pay for it and the debt of the loan will just build up.
275,,,Starting your adult life with significant debt is dangerous. A change in the economy would have an even bigger impact on this generation who are already struggling to get on the mortgage ladder
276,,,"Students who graduate most of the time donâ€™t even earn or find jobs in their subject that they graduated earning a certain amount does not apply to
Everyone has jobs a very hard to come by "
277,,,"However, repayment does start when earning above a certain threshold. When trying to save for a mortgage, consideration must be taken when looking at gross salary and repayment of fees deduction. "
278,,,payment gets wiped after so many years anyway
279,,,"The fact that they are repaying vast loans, means that they will not have expendable income, that the economy is dependant upon to thrive - the economy is consumer driven: this will only drive would be consumers out of the system. "
280,,,"In essence, the fees are a long term loan that isn't even paid back if a student earns to little, so the taxpayer actually foots the bill, technically subsidising low return degrees."
281,,A6CA8,The expense of affording extortionate rents in university towns means that many of the poorer students are unable to access university.
282,,,"No. This stops the poorer students being unable to go to uni, and if anything they are the ones who should be able to to provide for themselves. "
283,,,Many lower income families (and other families) do not contemplate going to  university as they do not want to be in debt. Also it must be known that there is a problem as this is why universities have things like Partnership schools where pupils from disadvantaged areas/school visit universities in order to encourage those from lower economic backgrounds to attend university.
284,,,The loan system may make a mistake that will cause issues with economic groups saving up to go to university.
285,,,The fees are too big of a barrier to accessibility of the courses
286,,,No loans are not the answer with interest rate going up and earning less even paying a little towards your loan dosent help with being debt free be paying off your loan forever 
287,,,"For some professions it is a necessity to complete a degree, therefore in these circumstances fees should be re-evaluated."
288,,,loan repayments are dependent on your salary and get wiped after so many years
289,,,"No One should be deprived of a university education, no matter their socio-economic status. "
290,,,"As Martin Lewis showed recently, the affordability isn't really that big an issue as students unable to pay the debt have it written off."
291,,A66CA16,Tuition fees are only half the issue; this wouild be better spent enabling the poorer students afford to live whilst learning.
292,,,"I do agree, however why should people be limited to what they can do with their life's depending on their bank balance. "
293,,,"Tuition fees do make things inacessibale as now it is a more considered decision as to whether to attend university and be in debt rather than just attending university, it means that perhaps some subjects are not being studied as if people do not see a profitable career path at the end of the degree it may not be worth sudying the topic. "
294,,,Tuition fees may make things inaccessible and make it harder for people to consider going to university and make their career path very uncertain.
295,,,Education can bring people out of lower economic groups but the fees may put them off certain careers 
296,,,Everyone should have access to any type of education be it primary or higher education everyone should have an equal chance at life 
297,,,"If an individual wishes to become a solicitor or a doctor then university is a must. However, the thought of fees and repayment will deter some."
298,,,Means not everyone will go to university for the sake of it
299,,,"This forces potential students to consider whether they can afford to go to university. This will deprive many people who are capable of achieving great success, simply because they cannot afford it. "
300,,,Nowadays students have the chance to undertake degree apprenticeships so there is more choice but a lower fee would mean an education isn't tied to a job.
301,,A68CA23,Young people should not feel like they have to study after the age of 18.
302,,,FE advice from schools is all well and good but that doesn't cover the huge costs involved for those from poorer backgrounds.
303,,,"It's the job of schools to educate, not to provide jobs. That is the responsibility of the government"
304,,,NAN
305,,,Young people are more than capable of making their own good decisions based on their own personal connections and online resources. It is a waste to spend money on advisors.
306,,,The cost of higher learning reflects the quality. Reducing or deferring the fee makes it less effective
307,,,NAN
308,,,"Schools do not have time to cover the current curriculum, never mind adding extra skills into it.  "
309,,,It should be a choice because 9k might be too much to some students yet it has to be paid back 
310,,,"9k is an exortionate amount, when the fees were previously 3k each the majority of graduates with average incomes were only just paying off their student loan debt, so you are just increasing the amount of government debt that only the very top earners will ever have the chance of paying back before the debt is wiped"
311,,A5CA1,"Good jobs are not always guaranteed after finishing university, espeically not straight away!"
312,,,The fear of the debt burden is often off-putting to people knowing they may be repaying it for so many years. 
313,,,Individuals should not need to go into debt to have a chance in the modern world.
314,,,Fees could be set at a lower amount.
315,,,All student loans achieve is getting young people to be comfortable with debt that they won't be able to pay off. 
316,,,But that education has to be funded somehow otherwise standards will fall. 
317,,,Good jobs are harder and harder to get these days
318,,,"Why should those who contribute back to society such as doctors, nurses and teachers spend years paying back money to contribute to society."
319,,,But then why push it to people should be easier to get 
320,,,"There are so many graduates now that it is difficult to guarantee getting a good job, also the idea of taking on over 30k of debt as it will include living fees if you havenâ€™t identified a job that you want to go into can seem excessive "
321,,A23CA21,You can sometimes earn more in a vocational job role than you can a job that requires a degree
322,,,"Degrees are needed in many essential, but lower paying fields like teaching or nursing.  If students are pushed to take degrees only in higher paying fields these jobs will never be filled."
323,,,Non-stem fields are often more profitable than some stem jobs. It is a gross oversimplification to assume otherwise.
324,,,"The world needs people qualified in all sorts of fields, it should be lower across the board to allow everyone a fair chance when getting a job."
325,,,"This means non-stem students are more likely to never pay off their debts, increasing costs for the government who provide the loans. Courses should be priced at values based on future earning estimates."
326,,,The current repayment structure allows for significant salaries before repayment is triggered. 
327,,,In that case should different courses cost different amounts?
328,,,Everyone should have a choice about what they do.  Years spent in employment that is not enjoyable will do nothing for one's mental health or well being.  
329,,,It doesnâ€™t help students understand sever at all
330,,,The fees should be kept in balance with the job prospects and the contact hours a student holds. Non-stem students do not receive value for money at 9k.
331,,A6CA9,"This increases the gap between the priviledged and the non. By giving scholarships to talented students, this pushes those who are only academic to the top and more creative and hands on workers to the bottom"
332,,,The number of scholarships available are disproportionate to the people needing them.  The ability to improve through education is essential for social mobility.   
333,,,"As technology improves, the opportunity for more people to become technical workers increases. Manual labour is not a fact of life, merely a fact of circumstance."
334,,,EVERYONE has the right to learn at a higher level and the fee is too high and at worst elitist.
335,,,"More than enough houses would still be built. If more young people take on degrees and move away from construction jobs, the demand for construction workers would increase. As demand increases, pay would increase too, enticing more people to become construction workers again. "
336,,,There are plenty of funding options available. Loans can be taken and repaid when a higher salary is earned. 
337,,,Everyone should have the opportunity to further their careers if they so wish.
338,,,This is ignoring students who miss out on scholarship opportunities yet have their heart set on following a certain career path.  You can still build houses with a degree.
339,,,Thereâ€™s a lot of mixed outcomes from graduates and itâ€™s not all good 
340,,,"There are very few scholarships available in the U.K. and often the people who need them the most are unaware of how to access them and do not have the right support. Also cost should not dictate someoneâ€™s prospects, someone should have non degree jobs because that is what they want to go into"
341,,A4CA1,Higher education should not be expected. Young people should be educated more on apprenticeships and other avenues where their university funds are paid for 
342,,,NAN 
343,,,The money that goes to free education does not have to come from taxes. Spending could be cut elsewhere.
344,,,"No not free, but substantially lower than it currently is, opening up higher learning to a wider proportion of the public."
345,,,"It's likely that the same amount of people would take up university education, as the people who would want university education already have fair access to it. Therefore there wouldn't be extra costs to tax payers."
346,,,That's how taxes work though. We all pay for essential services like the police without necessarily using them directly. 
347,,,NAN
348,,,Not everyone has access as the loans that are given are often lower than actually needed due to parental financial situations being considered during the application process.  Some parents cannot or will not subsidise their child's education.  
349,,,Yes free isnâ€™t a great start but jumping to 9k debt isnâ€™t either
350,,,If all taxes were raised to support people going through uni the government would cover the costs better and also there would be more high earners making it possible
351,,A5CA3,There are not always degree courses to suit everyone. What about talented hairdressers or beauty therapists?
352,,,They would need to have the degree to mean more than it does to merit being so much. A lot of people have the dree but cannot do the actual hands on job
353,,,"The interest accrues so quickly as you don't pay your loan back immediately (a very small percentage of jobs have a starting salary of 24k or more). Therefore, it will be years before many post graduates repay their loans years after graduating, meaning they are only ever paying a small amount of interest. "
354,,,"Students are left facing a huge debt and often a â€˜mickey mouseâ€™ degree. Only the graduates with certain types of degrees, the ones more likely to end with a high paid better job should pay larger tuition fees "
355,,,Too many people go to university without any idea why they are going.  Student loans are hardly ever paid back and encourage people who shouldnt be at university to go.
356,,,Many jobs requiring university education have positive social impact but not better pay so society not the individuals should support the training for those jobs.
357,,,Apprenticeships are a good way of receiving further education as well as gaining on the job experience and also earning a wage.  i feel that the current fee of 9k per year is too high and also the payback threshold is too high.  By reducing the fees to eg 6k and reducing the payback accordiningly this could be more self funding. 
358,,,"In my opinion now everyone have acces to education. If someone is smart, it's not a problem to take students loan and pay after that, or get some scholarship"
359,,,"Young people will start their adult lives with a debt, which must be paid. Some people will not go to university just to avoid them."
360,,,But no upfront payment does not refute the fact that it remains as a student loan payable in the future. Many countries in the EU offer free education up to university level. It is only logical that the UK offers free or affordable tuition fees for students. 
361,,,Students might be discouraged due to the steep fee and opt out of higher education.
362,,,"If people are acquiring professional and well-paid jobs from their studies at university, then any fees will not be an issue as they do not have to be paid upfront - they are paid after graduation and alongside tax."
363,,A73CA18,"So many people are applying for post graduate jobs that there is no guarantee of getting a ""good"" job after university anyway"
364,,,Never having the correct employment to pay back debt as there are no jobs
365,,,"Not all degrees guarantee a good job. For example, I graduated with a Law degree, and the average starting salary in my area is 15 - 20k per annum for a recently qualified graduate. This means that I will not be paying my loan back for a while, (until I receive a pay rise or return to university to complete the necessary post graduate degree to further one's career in law). It is therefore inevatble that I will be repaying the debt for a very long time. "
366,,,It depends on what the degree is. Some graduates are faced without many options but a lower paid job and therefore wouldnâ€™t get to pay the debt back as they would like to
367,,,"Not true,  you only pay it back once you earn over a certain amount.   If you dont reach that amount then you never pay it back.  Hence the country will be left with loads of debt."
368,,,Many jobs which require university education offer societal benefit but not increased pay so they may not have that resource.
369,,,Not all students finish up in a well paid job.  By reducing the fees and lowering the payback the scheme could be more self funding. 
370,,,"After uni students should get better paid job, so they will not have any problem with paying back loan"
371,,,"No university degree will guarantee a student high paying job. It depends on all sorts of other factors, like health condition, family situation, accomodation circumstances etc"
372,,,"A university degree does not guarantee a high paying job. Many careers require years of experience in below living wage before progressing to a pay-level that is suitable for loan repayment. Likewise, inflation and interest will make it difficult for loan takers to repay their loans as the loan increases in value over time.  "
373,,,"The students may shift their focus towards part-time jobs instead of education and it may result in lower grades, Also, students will have their own expenses to deal with before they can pay debt."
374,,,"Not necessarily - not everyone gets a good job straight after university, and those who had to take out private loans as their student loan didn't cover them will need to pay that money back fast. They can get into very serious financial trouble."
375,,A17CA4,What systems are in place? Even if there are bursaries available this stops as soon as you finish uni and job offers may not come in quickly
376,,,If you get a job you you either dont earn enough to pay back all the loan amd will be in debt for your whole life
377,,,What is the point in them being so high as a small percentage of it will be paid back. They might as well return to 3k and be paid back in full. 
378,,,It will need to be repaid eventually though. 
379,,,As soon as you start earning you should be paying back your debt.  If you cant afford to pay for the course then dont go.
380,,,Many students from deprived backgrounds can be discouraged from applying by the perception of a debt which will disadvantage them when seeking mortgages later in life.
381,,,Lower the fees to a more attainable repayment scheme.  A 3 or 4 year degree would saddle the student with an unrealistic debt and not help them on the property ladder.  By reducing fees and lowering the payback limit more money could be put back into universities making them self funding. 
382,,,"Students loan is very elastic, agreements can be long-time, so students shouldn't have any problems with paying back."
383,,,"But surely, these systems come with conditions and criteria which must be met. Not every situation, the student can get into, can be covered by external funding."
384,,,"The system has recently abolished the grant scheme aimed at struggling students. In a similar vein, return rate on student loans results in incremental loans for an infinite time horizon making it almost impossible to repay back through a wage job. "
385,,,"The cost of living is high as it is and more the time it takes them to repay their loans, higher will be the interest rates."
386,,,Those systems are only in place to help the very neediest of students - individuals will have to get themselves into a place of extreme financial hardship before they are assisted. These measures should be preventative rather than countermeasures.
387,,A6CA10,The government should be encouraging the less privaledged student to attend university but dropping the fees and therefore giving everyone an equal oppourtunity
388,,,Yes I agree that it will be costing the government but there is no other way of affording the fees unless ou come from a well off family
389,,,The eligibility for support loans at university has very narrow criteria. Not everyone has access to this support therefore won't have access to a university education as they cannot afford it. 
390,,,Once again it completely depends on what the degree is in and whether it will end in a decent job 
391,,,"9k is not enough,  when you consider the amount of knowledge and the earning potential you will get at the end of it"
392,,,the help is offered in the form of a loan which disadvantages them in later life and the benefits of education to the economy and society outweigh the cost of the degree to the government
393,,,Why should the tax payer have to pay for the privileged few to gain an education.  At the moment it is very elitist - if you can afford an education good luck to you but if you cannot afford it tough.  by reducing fees and lowering repayment more money could be generated reducing the elitist aspect. 
394,,,Achieving degree should be worthless. And there is always money related to that after all
395,,,"That's right, but isn't it the government's aim and purpose- to raise highly educated society. The system must provide for the people, who will take care of this system. And if the government wants capable, intelligent, highly educated people to work in the country, then it must help to educate these people first."
396,,,The cost of a degree is much less than 9K if the graduates of health and allied health degrees are considered. The cost of producing competent graduates who reduce the cost of hiring expat will dramatically decrease the costs paid by the government to run its operations especially in the NHS. 
397,,,The underpriviledged have to struggle more before then can stand on their own feet for something that is a basic right 
398,,,That's what student loans and bursaries are for. Tuition fees are paid after graduation and so are not an issue.
399,,A4CA5,Why should only the economic status of a person entitle them to a scholarship?
400,,,The criteria for scholarships are very high with lots applying and lots missing out. Some who are more hard working deserve them more but dont fit certain criteria
401,,,Not all poor student receive scholarships. 
402,,,And how many are there? How easy are they to come across?
403,,,"You shouldnt get something for nothing.  In life you have to earn things, why should poor people get better advantages that people who are not poor."
404,,,There are very limited scholarships and an unrepresentative population in universities will lead to unrepresentative people in power later in life.
405,,,What an elitist argument.  Who is to say who are poor people.  Why should tax payers have to fund anybodys education.  
406,,,"Access to education isn't restricted right now, and fees are showing value of education"
407,,,There is always a competion between students who want a scholarship. Demand is bigger than the offer.
408,,,"Disadvantaged students should not be confined to their achievements or grades. The nature of the disadvantage does not change based on their academic achievement; if a student is struggling financially, they are less likely to be high achievers. Therefore, high achieving disadvantaged students are a minority within a minority. "
409,,,The students will also have to work part-time and study which may impact their performance
410,,,There's also student loans and grants for everyone - students from underprivileged backgrounds get plenty of money to live on.
411,,A5CA15,University qualifications do not lead to guaranteed better jobs.
412,,,Less foreign doctors less immigrants taking jobs our children should be doing 
413,,,But there need to be enough of the 'better' jobs as there are not enough of them or that you need to do further university to gain these jobs which is a lot more than 9k
414,,,if better eductation gives thame a better job then thats when they should have to start paying the loan back but if they are poor the government should help
415,,,"Free education will lead for better social life, as everybody will get the chance to gain the high education. "
416,,,"If you have to pay for something, I'm pretty sure that you gonna use that wisely in future - because it's your capital. Your money and your time."
417,,,Better education is universally accessible. Expense creates unequal opportunity. 
418,,,People cant afford to get the education they desire
419,,,Their should be no fees at all
420,,,"It can be good and free, people who cant afford education would like to perform better jobs too, they just do not have an opportunity"
421,,,Better education does not directly correlate to better performance. You also aren't likely to receive a better education by paying more if there are no standards for the educational quality. 
422,,A73CA21,"Cherry picking students doesnâ€™t offer education for all and access to specialities to a wide range of people, "
423,,,You can not earn and save in this life time itâ€™s hard to get by as it is once you start earning you are stuck in the cycle of paying bills working and waiting for the next pay day
424,,,"Scholoarships are very sought after with many applying and it is luck and if the face fits criteria. How realistically could you save up the money and still afford living - food, housing etc(not a social life!)"
425,,,how is a student ment to save the funds first where are they going to find the money when they are a student
426,,,"Its any way very difficult to start a life after the university, most of the salary will go on the fee"
427,,,"Besides that if someone want to achieve goal - will do, eveny if it will cost that person a lot of money at the start."
428,,,"There are very limited scholarships, to limit lower economic students to being restricted means that the potential of our youth isn't being accessed to its fullness."
429,,,If you have to have a job and go to leactures when do you have time to do assignments 
430,,,Fees should be stopped. People dont want to go into further eduction with the worry of being in debt for years after.
431,,,Scholarship is a competition and they can be very random
432,,,"A student may not find their 'stride' until they are within higher education, barring them from scholarship opportunities. Why should a student from less fortunate means have to 'prove' themselves by saving money elsewhere before considering an opportunity to apply and realistically receive the same quality? That's inequality. "
433,,A17CA15,Education is fully funded up until 18 / Serious thought should be given to weigh up the pros and cons of further education by each individual.
434,,,But eventually it will and I know of a lot of students who donâ€™t have jobs to pay it back because there isnâ€™t much around especially in small towns pay is low 
435,,,Just because it doesnt need repaid immediately doesnt mean it is a good thing - you will end up in debt for the rest of your life if you cant get a job with a very good wage
436,,,if the loan is not needed to be repaid immediately and only when they have a well paod job this is better
437,,,Agree
438,,,"But when they will start proper job after uni, they will get much better money. Students loan shouldn't be obstacle"
439,,,The weight of the loan is undeniable and once you begin earning above a certain amount you need to begin paying it back despite external pressures
440,,,Having to repay loans and work and all course work is too much to expect of anyone then when qualified having to work and pay loans off when have houde bills etc its manic and bound to send mental health into everyone 
441,,,People may be worried about what their future changes in income are like. Things might change. People might lose jobs. And then not have the funding to repay back 
442,,,A loan is a loan and add to that is interest fee
443,,,There are other countries in which the cost of education is subsidized by higher tax rates. Coincidentally a lot of these countries also have higher rated education quality. There are ways provide affordable education without it being a crushing burden on the student. 
444,,A6CA14,University attendance is for students to specialise in a field. 
445,,,Itâ€™s impossible to learn earn and live you have to make a choice and sadly children these days can not see a way out unless they get a job and help from parents who barely earn enough themselves 
446,,,But there are no jobs at the end of it that doesnt mean either moving to another country which is what a small number of the graduates in my course had to do to get a job or go on to do a PhD with would be higher than the 9k
447,,,The sector has to be funded by the government and people need to value a university education.
448,,,"Yes thats true, people need to value the education, but maybe the fee could be lower? So more young people will the opportunity for their dream"
449,,,Students should think about loan as investment - in their own future. And they will appreciate that with time
450,,,The loan doesn't cover living or travel expenses and students often end up taking out other loans.
451,,,Having to fund an education is wrong as it puts to much pressure on people when trying to.learn and better themselves 
452,,,Maybe if the government cared more about the smaller people the correct use for tax payers money will be funded to good use. Rather than boycotting the amount charged for one person to make their lives bettered in education
453,,,"There are many other ways to fund the sector, the fees are just too high and sound scary for many"
454,,,Keeping a prospective student out of the system by placing them into a huge debt further enforces the idea that someone from less fortunate means is destined to be stuck within their 'class'. It can be argued that having a financial burden is a significant disadvantage to a student that only needs to focus on their studies. 
455,,A4CA6,"University education is a privilege, not a right. "
456,,,Not fair of someone wants to learn they should be encouraged as best as possible 
457,,,A lot of the population today would probably meet the criteria as there are not many who can afford it
458,,,I feel a critria is needed and concessions given to the people who cant afford it
459,,,No argument
460,,,"If everyone will have access to everything, level of education will dropped - because education system will need adjust to level of students."
461,,,Everyone no matter what their ability should have the option to follow all educational paths.  
462,,,When someone has gone as far with education as possible and.get a full time job maybe theu could then pay a certain amount to there university 
463,,,If their applying for university chances are they already meet the qualifying criteria in achieving their grades through college. 
464,,,"are we talking about more and more again tests? A lot of high school student are told they are not good enough for the university, so do not even have an opportunity to try, everything is set"
465,,,"The same should be applied to someone who is financially able to afford it to raise the quality and stature of the degree itself. You devalue the quality of a degree if the barrier for entry is ""Who can pay the most?"""
466,,A73CA23,It’s not ideal starting your post-education life with a long-term debt hanging over you
467,,,It should be government funded we need to encourage our own countries children to strive to be the best and less employment from abroad doctors etc
468,,,"Yes, it can be done like that, but again, why people who is earning over a certain level have to pay the fee, but people over this level - no. Is a bit unfair. "
469,,,People need to take responsibility for their choices - so buy choosing to undertake a degree there is a moral & financial responsibility to repay the investment that the country has put into you by covering the fees in advance; & there must be accountability for those who don't.
470,,,The fee should be repayable by all as it is unfair on the taxpayer to fund the shortfall.
471,,,Having a highly educated workforce will contribute far more to the economy and pay off multiple times over the government tuition expense.
472,,,When you are going to university you shouldn't need to pay as the children they are teaching will become the new important people.
473,,,"This still discourages some students, particularly those from backgrounds who do not want any form of debt. The interest rates also keep rising."
474,,,Student loans should be treated as loans to be taken seriously by students. The US’s student loans affect credit score and as a result the US has a higher repayment rate. 
475,,,"Well, it doesn't in the UK but the interest rates are quite high and force the student to find a job as fast as possible after graduating, otherwise he/she accumulates more and more interest "
476,,A9CA3,It’s demeaning having to apply for help in order to be at a level playing field in education with those from more affluent backgrounds
477,,,Life is hard right now for Everyone and everything so costs out people off extra learning 
478,,,"But not for those who already got a high education and wants to get a second, as they found that it not what they wanted to do(did a wrong choice)."
479,,,"People from less priviledged backgrounds are significantly disadvantaged already & it is morally reprehensible of society to reaffirm this disadvantage, throughout most of their lives, with debt for those who are trying to better themselves."
480,,,Although there are finance options the amount loaned is often based on parental income not on what they can afford to help subsidise. 
481,,,Not everyone is guarenteed a scholarships and loans will have to be repayed some with excessive interest fees.
482,,,There might be someone bright and super smart but they could be poor
483,,,Those other options still maintain social injustice and could contribute to increased insurances of imposter syndrome which could in turn even negatively impact student achievement.
484,,,Scholarships are mostly reserved for international student and most bursaries do not cover tuition fees or are based on academic performance
485,,,scholarships are highly selective and often do not cover the whole cost of the degree. loans are only for the tuition fees - if the student moves into another city he/she also needs to pay for rent etc.
486,,A4CA8,"Poorer students should be supported full stop, not just offered credit which they will have to pay back later in life"
487,,,That encourages them to not go for a higher paid job
488,,,No argument...
489,,,But what this is doing is to further penalise those with the least financial backing with them for the a significant amount of their lives - further worsening issue like getting onto the housing market.
490,,,"However, they still owe the money and therefore start their working life in debt. "
491,,,That's still money that you will have to pay back for a long period of time which could've been spent elsewhere
492,,,It would just be unfair on other people who have put in more effort in studies than the people who can afford it but hasn't put in any effort in studies.
493,,,"In which case the loans as they are, are currently not going to be paid back fully anyway. Why keep contributing to this broken system?"
494,,,The loan system has scrapped income-based grants for poorer students with higher day-to-day expenses making it almost impossible for them to survive without taking twice as much in loans as their counterparts
495,,,"no, you pay it back after a certain salary which is basically if you earn more than the very basic income. Interest rates are high too"
496,,A4CA13,Those skillsets are then therefore only readily available to those who can afford to pay for it
497,,,The government should invest therefor saving money else where long term less poverty housing benefits 
498,,,Don’t know what to say
499,,,"Society as a whole benefits from having a well trained workforce - be that through tax payments, making the country more attractive for employees, fulfilling social roles (eg Drs & nurses) - &, in the same way that the county invests in transport links & subsidies/grants for companies, people should also be seen as an investment."
500,,,"If you don't want to pay to develop your skills then find another career, it is unfair to expect taxpayers to train you."
501,,,The money provided by jobs employing that skill set could repay that spent money many times over
502,,,The parents might not think its not worth it
503,,,It is not fair to prevent someone from enveloping their skillset when their potential could bring untold benefit to society.
504,,,The opportunity of education should not be limited based on fees. Education should be an option that is available for all regardless of their career path or choice. 
505,,,Yes but what if a student wants to become someone whos profession requires a university degree?
