argh1,1,IT IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE FOR STUDENTS FROM A POOR BACKGROUND,
argh2,2,"Because everyone has the right to have a degree, not only the reach ones!",
argh3,3,To make it accessible to students from different backgrounds,
argh4,4,It makes higher education inaccessible to the working classes. ,
argh5,5,education is a human right and therefore should be free for everyone,
argh6,6,"education should be free as well as health services, it should be a human right",
argh7,7,"Most students can't afford paying 9k to study, students may have talent but due to their income source they might be blocked from entering an University",
argh8,8,Education should be easily accessible to every social class,
argh9,9,The country needs an educated work force to fulfil societies needs.,
argh10,10,I think education benefits us all and should therefore be free to people in the UK,
argh11,11,The fees should be abolished because students end up  with a huge debt once finishing university. ,
argh12,12,I think that university fees should be abolished because everybody have rights to learn.,
argh13,13,Because education should be unconditionally supported.,
argh14,14,"
Because students do not have money",
argh15,15,I was at University when fees were 3k a year. Students are now paying for 1 year what i paid for the full duration of my bachelors degree.,
argh16,16,To give a chance for students from lower egsistence status,
argh17,17,9K per year is too much for students,
argh18,18,not equal opportunities in education ,
argh19,19,The fees limit the participation of poorer students.,
argh20,20,University Education should be free for all,
argh21,21,Giving equal opportunities for all levels of society to have an education,
argh22,22,"
The fees should be abolished because they impede the development of young people who could contribute much to the EU economy",
argh23,23,more students would come to the university,
argh24,24,Education should be free,
argh25,25,Learning should be as cheap as possible to including as most people s possible,
argh26,26,families don't earn enough money to provide such value,
argh27,27,It is too expensive for people to pay every year.,
argh28,28,"Everyone should have access to a free university education, regardless of their economic capacity",
argh29,29,students are poor people,
argh30,30,University fees should be abolished because education should be free,
argh31,31,Because everybody is not wealthy enough to pay such large fees .,
argh32,32,Governments have enough money to support universities.,
argh33,33,Means some people feel they can't go to university,
argh34,34,Better education for everyone leads to a better country with high paying and more successful jobs etc,
argh35,35,I believe that it is an enormous amount to pay,
argh36,36,"
I believe that fees should be abolished because they are too high, not everyone can afford such an expense. Therefore, knowledge is available for certain privileged groups.",
argh37,37,They are too expensive and leave students in debts they can't afford,
argh38,38,Education should be available to all regardless of income ,
argh39,39,Everybody should have access to free education as it will get the right people for the right study thus proving ( perhaps) more successful.,
argh40,40,education should be free for everyone and people should'n have to pay to learn,
argh41,41,It is too expensive,
argh42,42,Its beyond the reach of all but the richest of society.,
argh43,43,there is no clear explanation or breakdown as to where the money goes,
argh44,44,I think that 9K fees maintain social injustices for those who can afford higher education and thus should be abolished in order to fight social inequality. ,
argh45,45,Because of a greater dept of families in Great Britain.,
argh46,46,Education should be a right and provided for free and universities should ha ve another means of adquire funds.,
argh47,47,Education must be as cheap as possible so everyone can decide if they would like to go to university,
argh48,48,It discriminated against poorer parts of society,
argh49,49,because 9k it's a lot of money,
argh50,50,It's way too high for the same level of service at universities,
argh51,51,Everyone deserves a chance at higher education regardless of cost,
argh52,52,It is too expensive,
argh53,53, It gets students into debt before they even start their working life.,
argh54,54,It puts people off university education,
argh55,55,"Education should be avaiable for everyone, not for only ones who can afford it.",
argh56,56,People cant afford it,
argh57,57,College fees must be waived because studies are essential for the growth of any human being and many do not go to university because of financial problems.,
argh58,58,Education should be free for equality of opportunity.,
argh59,59,"If you want your country to grow, you should give every student a change to follow a study at an university, no only the rich ones.",
argh60,60,As it's unfair for the people who cant afford it,
argh61,61,They get written off after certain amount of years anyway,
argh62,62,"Because, education should be for free, everybody should have oppurtunity to study",
argh63,63,"Education is a right and, therefore, should be treated as such and be made free.",
argh64,64,It makes higher education less accessible for people coming from poorer households,
argh65,65,Education should be free regardless of social background,
argh66,66,It’s not fair for students that don’t have the possibility to pay that price.,
argh67,67,because we are investing in our education,
argh68,68,Every students in Europe should have the rights to study for free.,
argh69,69,The amount that they charge is way too much in certain countries.,
argh70,70,In the long run the owed amount is ridiculously high.,
argh71,71,Too expensive and the cost acts as a deterrent to potential students.,
argh72,72,Going to university is already sufficiently expensive to charge students even more.,
argh73,73,"First an foremost reason is that not everyone has an equal chance to attend, because 9k might be okay just on its own but when someone has to study for 4-5 years then that goes up to almost 50k. Which is the price of a small apartment. That's a lot of money, and a lot of people don't have that amount of money. If they decide to opt for a loan, then they're still in debt. And if they don't go to a university, their education is certainly lacking in the work field.",
argh74,74, Good education is investment in society.,
argh75,75, Ι believe that university fees should be abolished because they make education a privilege for a few,
argh76,76,"University fees block the way to studying for students who cannot afford it, and it does not promote equality.",
argh77,77,Because of high fees in education I wasn't able to finish my degree because I HAD TO CHOSE between do I eat or do I study... ,
argh78,78,Education should accessible for any  student's who proves to be smart enough. ,
argh79,79,"University fees of 9k should be abolished because the amount asked to be paid by the students is very high and most of them might need to take a student loan to continue their studies, placing them in debt even before they start to work.",
argh80,80,Students should concentrate in tjheir studies instead of work,
argh81,81,"Fees cause inqualities between rich and poor students, which can't afford to pay university.",
argh82,82,"It places a big financial burden onto the student, because they rarely have the money readily available.",
argh83,83,Because bettering people's education is worthwhile to society as we have a higer-skilled workforce,
argh84,84,Education is essential for the prosperity of the nation and it should be funded by the taxpayer,
argh85,85,As University is a form of bettering yourself and therefore should not have to cost.,
argh86,86,"The fee is too high; it was originally set as a ceiling, but Universities rushed to the top in charging this maximum.",
argh87,87,I think the fees should be abolished as it is a relatively recent change in funding which possibly prevents some groups from attending university. ,
argh88,88,It forces prospective students to take on significant debt. This will be a heavy burden to non-STEM students who are likely to earn less than their counterparts.,
argh89,89,Students are trying to better themselves and get a good job ,
argh90,90,Students don't work which means they have to go in debt which is not sure 8f they will be able to pay back.,
argh91,91,"In some countries it is much cheaper or even free, with the same benefits",
argh92,1,TO ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO GO TO UNIVERSITY,
argh93,2,The intelligence shouldn't be measured by the bank account!,
argh94,3,To eliminate pressure coming from student loans,
argh95,4,Students are in debt before even getting a job.,
argh96,5,university fees restrict education to the privileged at the expense of people from lower income families not being able to study,
argh97,6,The more educated people are the better the world can become because people will think deeper before making any decision,
argh98,7,"If the 9k fee isn't abolished you will create a restrict group of people who's parents went to University and grandparents and so one so that they could earn more money and in that way put their son in the university, in this case people who are rich will get richier and the poor will get poorly ",
argh99,8,Paying for education drives poor people to feeling excluded,
argh100,9,When the fees were introduced we were assured they would never reach this level.,
argh101,10,Universities should not be run like a business but state funded instead ,
argh102,11,"Education of all types should be free,",
argh103,12,I think that university fees should be abolished because it is discriminazion in my opinion.,
argh104,13,Because students may have to take up loans which and drive them or their family into debt later.,
argh105,14,"
The state should pay for studies.",
argh106,15,It adds unnecessary stress as they get a job even if it is was not related to their field.,
argh107,16,to avoid a big loan before starting a career,
argh108,17,If Scotland has no fees then England should figure out how to do it or reduce it,
argh109,18,less students will be coming in UK ,
argh110,19,Fees should not be charged for people training in medicine and nursing,
argh111,20,It will be impossible for most students to pay off the debt,
argh112,21,"Making possible for a more educated society, by allowing everyone to have a degree",
argh113,22,Many young people can not afford such expensive fees even if they would earn some money somewhere.,
argh114,23,the university would have a better name,
argh115,24,The government should be able to cover or minimize education fees,
argh116,25,"Fees will encourage students to search for other sources of knowledge, that may not be helpful",
argh117,26,"education should be cheaper, 9k is too much money to spend",
argh118,27,It doesn't give people with more needs the chance to be able to go to university.,
argh119,28,They are abusive and the state could assume them guaranteed access according to academic merits,
argh120,29,student usually dont have time to work,
argh121,30,University fees should be abolished to help people without income continue their studies,
argh122,31,Because chances of succes should be equal for everybody in despite of money,
argh123,32,Taxes that have been paid can cover that demand,
argh124,33,unfair for those who went to uni after the rise,
argh125,34,Allows equal access for everyone,
argh126,35,Fees could be charged but not 9K for all schools,
argh127,36,"
I believe that fees should be abolished so that everyone can learn and acquire new skills.",
argh128,37,Education in the UK should be free,
argh129,38,There are no fees in Scotland ,
argh130,39,If University is only an option for those with parents who can afford the fees it limits the talent pool.,
argh131,40,"if we have free education for people, we will have a better society ",
argh132,41,It is debilitating for young people to start life by taking on this huge debt,
argh133,42,Education should be encouraged. Most education will lead to better paid jobs and as such more tax revenue.,
argh134,43,it limits students from poorer backgrounds getting into higher education,
argh135,44,Because UK economy could be affected by Brexit and people could be hesitant to pay as much as 9K fees. Having lower fees may encourage more people to enrol.,
argh136,45,"Also, some of the poorer families have to take a loan, mortgage and it is bad.",
argh137,46,"With the current evolution of society, university degrees are shifting from being a optional path to another educational step.",
argh138,47,having fees in universities is having a barrier for the growth of society,
argh139,48,They can not afford further education meaning that they won’t be able to get as good jobs in the future even if they are just as intelligent. ,
argh140,49,because children's parents already pay for university by paying their taxes,
argh141,50,no guaranteed job opportunities once they complete their studies,
argh142,51,Not everyone is in a position to be able to afford these fees,
argh143,52,"education is a right,",
argh144,53,A degree is important for a lot of careers and the idea of these costs will put a lot of students off studying to degree level.,
argh145,54,It sets people out with huge debt,
argh146,55,Students are already spending a lot of money on university education.,
argh147,56,Puts people off applying,
argh148,57,"The university fees must be discharged because the amount paid in homes, transport and food is enough.",
argh149,58,Educated people are good for the economy so it should be free to go.,
argh150,59,"Student should use their time for studying only, not for jobs to pay their education.",
argh151,60,Most tuition fees are never paid back anyway as people never earn enough to pee it back ,
argh152,61,It does not mean you are paying for better education.,
argh153,62,a lot of people dont have enought money to go study,
argh154,63,The amount of money students pay is way too high for the conditions they are given.,
argh155,64,Students have to take loans to afford it and start their adult life with debt,
argh156,65,Students shouldn't have to get into debt in order to pursue their education,
argh157,66,It’s way above the price of fees in other countries like Germany and Denmark where there are no fees at all.,
argh158,67,in other countries of the European Union education is free,
argh159,68,"If the students have to pay the 9k fees, they have to work beside the school.",
argh160,69,The provided scholarships barely cover the fees imposed by universities.,
argh161,70,To have a loan so early in life is damning.,
argh162,71,The majority of students do not end up paying off full debt of university fees.,
argh163,72,"Such a huge amount of money places a high burden on educational possibilities, making it impossible for many people to access education, which is terrible and backwards (reminiscences of elitist educational scenario from the past).",
argh164,73,"A country that wants to have the best working force should take care of its working force. By lowering the costs of the entrances, from 9k to perhaps 500-1000, it would create a new pool of future-students that will attend, educate themselves, and be far more productive in this world than those that have a simple high school education.",
argh165,74,There is no division between the poor and the rich.,
argh166,75,"I believe that education must be  responsibility of the country so that society advances significantly because you can not exclude through tuition people who may be smarter and capable of doing much more than someone who simply has the money to pay. Moreover, ""Dad's money"" should not be the criterion of access to education",
argh167,76,"In my opinion higher education at bachelor-master level should be still widely accessible, and such a high fee certainly does not make it accessible.",
argh168,77,"Imagine...much more people would study, od every age , because some people don't know what to study yet when they are 20. There should be maybe some fees but very symbolic so everyone can get an education he dream about etc; imagine the whole world educated (if we apply that everywhere) ! ...maybe there would be less agreesions,less wars, and other behaviour coming often from lack of education",
argh169,78,There shouldn't be tolerating standing that we are all equal but others are more. ,
argh170,79,Another reason for it is due to the fact that the state should keep investing in the education of their citizens and that amount could be a deterrent for poorer students to enroll in an university.,
argh171,80,We pay too much taxes,
argh172,81,"The university should promote talented students, not rich students.",
argh173,82,Introducing larger fees doesn't necessarily mean that education quality will be higher.,
argh174,83,"so that it is accessible to those who want to persure a subject, regardless of cost",
argh175,84,University education opens up more opportunties than can be bought with money,
argh176,85,University is a form of gaining a higher education and qualification which in turn makes a better workforce within the country.,
argh177,86,"Students are being made to feel as though they are taking on a heavy debt (when in fact it is more like a tax); fees could be taken in a tax format directly, saving the student from feeling in debt.",
argh178,87,They should be abolished as it means graduates are leaving university with astronomical levels of debt. ,
argh179,88,It encourages a mentality that further education is only for the wealthy.,
argh180,89,Starting out with debt before they even get a job,
argh181,90,Universities should he free just like schools.,
argh182,91,"Some students can not have great benefits, they are denied great opportunities and a possible better quality of life thanks to the studies",
argh183,1,THE COST OF LIVING IN LONDON IS TOO HIGH TO AFFORD THOSE FEES,
argh184,2,Nowadays someone who doesn't have a degree has problems to find a decent job.,
argh185,3,To enable students to focus on studying vs earning money for studies,
argh186,4,Fee free education will encourage more diversity in the student population and later in the workplace.,
argh187,5,free university would create new opportunities that would be equal to everyone,
argh188,6,if everyone were educated people would be more responsible,
argh189,7,"You will have people who aren't smart but have money having works that require someone inteligent and doing their works poorly, in cases such as doctors this causes a concerning situation, you want some rich brat to give you pain-killers to a ruptured appendix? Because I don't",
argh190,8,Central government spending on universities should be a priority of financial strategy,
argh191,9,If parents are well off this is not a problem - are we saying only the rich can obtain higher education?,
argh192,10,It's seems anyone can get to university these days even if they don't meet standards. It should be results and intelligence that get people into university and that should be funded by the government ,
argh193,11,"Education should be assessable to all and huge fees could put people off, especially those from poorer bank grounds ",
argh194,12,I think that university fees should be abolished because so many talented people are in the world who can not afford education. These people should disappear in the world just because they are poor?!,
argh195,13,Because education is a birthright to everyone and should not be charged such a fee EVER,
argh196,14,"
To encourage young people to learn.",
argh197,15,It makes a lot of students hesistant to even go to university.,
argh198,16,to give a similar chance to learn for everyone,
argh199,17,Education is essential to better civilisation and should be accessible by all those who desire to learn,
argh200,18,bias towards students of mid/high class background ,
argh201,19,Students should not have that level of debt when they graduate,
argh202,20,The government is effectively paying the interest,
argh203,21,"Release of stress from students, by not having financial pressure put on top of all the other commitments",
argh204,22,"For many young people, studying is the only way to achieve decent living conditions in the future. You may think about a slightly smaller fee or one that will be paid after graduation and finding the right job.",
argh205,23,"
the university will be able to expand new study programs",
argh206,24,Education fees are overrated ,
argh207,25,Universities should be paid by the state and not individual students,
argh208,26,"they shouldn't be abolished by complete, maybe 1k is good",
argh209,27,Universities have functioned in the past with nearly 0 in fees so it will be quite possible to reduce.,
argh210,28,"They encourage that they can only study the children of wealthy families, assuming for others a great economic effort",
argh211,29,when students go to work then dont have enough time to study and they get bad results,
argh212,30,University fees should be abolished because universities should rely on public funding,
argh213,31,Some people who does not have the funds could be great students,
argh214,32,Money that every country spend to buy weapons can cover that demand,
argh215,33,Potentially life long debt,
argh216,34,People aren't stuffed with debt the rest of their career ,
argh217,35,It is not appropriate for someone studying Medicine and someone studying some other major to be charged the same amount. The Medicine part is just an example,
argh218,36,"
I believe that fees should be lifted, which will make everyone equal.",
argh219,37,It gives everyone equal opportunities for education,
argh220,38,Jobs need filled with educated people,
argh221,39,Living as a student is difficult enough just getting by with little side jobs. If a fee then has to be paid as well the students who are not so fortunate run the risk of ending up with huge debts.,
argh222,40,to avoid that people with capacities don't go to the university because of the finances situation,
argh223,41,Does not benefit universities,
argh224,42,Profit making should not be the main focus of universities. ,
argh225,43,the stress the debts place on students is awful,
argh226,44,Because higher education institutions should cut other expenses instead of having 9K fees.,
argh227,45,Education should be available for everyone no matter how wealthy you are.,
argh228,46,"Students that have to conciliate university with work cannot give the proper focus on their studies, which harm their academics.",
argh229,47,pay and then study is a very antiquated model that shouldn't be put in place in educational institutions,
argh230,48,"Students can not afford housing after university 

It won’t let me view page 3, so I will continue with reasonings here. 

They can’t afford it as their debt prevents them being able to own their own property in the future. 

Reason 3:
Many other countries provide university for free, and some such as those in Denmark even give a small salary to encourage people to go to get a more educated population. Why shouldn’t it be the same in England?",
argh231,49,because a fee like this maybe discourage gifted children that can not afford this amount of money to go to university,
argh232,50,Less people will be going to university simply because of the high fees,
argh233,51,It is unreasonable to force people into debt just to afford higher education,
argh234,52, it shouldn't be possible to some people only,
argh235,53,Some families can’t afford it in the first place.,
argh236,54,It never used to be that costly,
argh237,55,"I understand that it might be some financial help for universities, but I think that universities should be funded by government.",
argh238,56,Starting off ur life in debt,
argh239,57,College fees should be waived as it should be a duty free worldwide,
argh240,58,Education should be free for all in a civilised society.,
argh241,59,It encourages people to educate themselves (more).,
argh242,60,Everyone should have the right to a education withet they can afford it ornot ,
argh243,61,Puts pressure on people thinking they need to have that amount to go,
argh244,62,"i think, 9k is a lot of money for regular people to pay for university",
argh245,63,"The 9k university fees, even the student finance system, don't provide equal opportunities for everyone and form an elitist system.",
argh246,64,I think it is inadequate value for money in many cases,
argh247,65,Low wages makes it unprofitable,
argh248,66,There is no need to charge that amount of money when you can achieve it through European and private funds.,
argh249,67,too much money for a year at university,
argh250,68,"The achievement of the student's will fall off, because they can't focus 100% on their school.",
argh251,69,Families with monetary difficulties usually don't have the capibilites to send their children to university.,
argh252,70,There are other working schooling systems today without these fees in other countries.,
argh253,71,Student debt is sold to private companies (SLC) as otherwise government would be in a bad deficit from university fees.,
argh254,72,"Education should be a right for everyone and not be a cold business, struggle and 'mortgage for life' for those who with great effort manage to access the university system. Universities should be a field of improvement for a flourishing and better educated society, not a restrictive wall that impedes it. ",
argh255,73,"Repaying the debt is highly unlikely. Although it might not be as much as it can eventually pile up in countries like the US, even 40k, unpaid, is an economic time bomb. It literally hurts the economy, by keeping this scheme up. The effort should be focused away from disregarding unpaid debt and making education more manageable and approachable for everyone.",
argh256,74,"Undergraduate students are able and determined, not wealthy students.",
argh257,75,"if university fees are applied, there will be no social mobility, giving no options to people from lower classes to advance.",
argh258,76,"University fees also force students to take student loans and further aggravate their situation (if for example they already have troubles). Not to mention, that the wide interest makes the decidents eager to rise the fees.",
argh259,77,"higher educational level in the country, country progresses in every area (medecine,technology etc.),there are so many intelligent and hungry of  knowledge people -give them the chance to to somehing with their lifes; so they can also transmit that love of knowledge to their children (?!) Paying so much  for education is.....the end of culture for me",
argh260,78,"Well educated nation can achieve great things easier, like technology revolution to daily life. ",
argh261,79,Another reason is because it limits the number of persons with higher education and it takes away the opportunity of poorer students improve their life by getting better jobs that require more complicate set of skills.,
argh262,80,Most European Countries don't charge fees at the universities,
argh263,81,Everyone should be able to learn specific knowledge and to show his qualities.,
argh264,82,Large tuition fees create a big skill gap in the labour market. Inability to pay for your tuition doesn't mean inability to learn and achieve academic awards.,
argh265,83,because the policy makers themselves paid no tuition fees and therefore it is fairer to everyone.,
argh266,84,"It is inequitable across social groups, some of whom fear debt",
argh267,85,It puts people of from higher their education as they are scared of being in debt so therefore may not continue gaining higher qualifications because of this and in turn makes our work force of lower abilities. ,
argh268,86,Previous generations did not have to pay fees.,
argh269,87,"Interest rates are currently rising which means added debt for students, graduates and the country as a whole. ",
argh270,88,Many young people do not understand how the debt they take on is repaid as they have not had a financial education and therefore might not understand the gravity of the situation.,
argh271,89,So many other Bill's going to university for students to worry about ,
argh272,90,I think the fee should be abolished for students from UK and to apply for students from other countrues.,
argh273,91,"In my opinion, all or most universities should have affordable tuition fees and living costs, tuition fees should be the same for national and international students",
