Depth5_1,Depth4_1,Universities may become redundant if job that require a degree need to be reimbursed buy the employer but equally they should have some incentives to get people into the jobs without the risk of debt ,
Depth5_2,Depth4_1,"The repayment of the loan would not necessarily be easier as this is dependent on personal
Circumstances, if it’s a mature student they may have got into increased debt putting themselves through the training and still having to pay a mortgage and support a family",
Depth5_3,Depth4_1,"Arguing that jobs requiring degrees pay more fails to understand that it takes a long time to earn the top salaries. Loans may cover the cost of education, but the cost of living during and after education need to be factored in, and with the cost of rent mortgages etc it not just a case of a loan, its working night and day to become qualified, experienced and to feed and house yourself and dependents. It discriminates against people with no savings or other financial support networks.",
Depth5_4,Depth4_1,A degree will give you lots of knowledge you can bring to the job experience can be gained ,
Depth5_5,Depth4_1,If the country wants a skilled workforce that can effectively fill roles in various industries they should be willing to invest in young people - many people are capable of doing well in many industries but simply cannot invest in themselves,
Depth5_6,Depth4_15,The government could give out grants to specific companies to pay for people to have the degree and if they say don’t pass then they have to repay the grants ,
Depth5_7,Depth4_15,Not everyone that pays taxes uses benefits but this is still provided to people that need it using the tax payers money ,
Depth5_8,Depth4_15,"Allowing people of all social and economic access to reasonable education is fundammental to a society focused on development, change and equality. Its a ridiculous comment to make, that some people pay taxes and dont go to university. Some people don't have children but taxes pay for schools, never get sick but taxes go to the NHS. The list goes on. ",y
Depth5_9,Depth4_15,Everyone should be given the chance of further education for free ,
Depth5_10,Depth4_15,"A small increase in taxes would cover the vast majority of university fees. In addition, we could tax corporations or the rich, rather than individuals, to cover the cost.",
Depth5_11,Depth4_27,Education should be free for all and should be an extension on yo school ,
Depth5_12,Depth4_27,If you are willing to get into debt to invest in your future you shouldn’t be penalised by having to pay interest ,
Depth5_13,Depth4_27,"If people of restricted financial resources are forced into a loan to fund their education, they should not have an unreasonably high interest rate thrust upon them. If there is only one provider of student loans (and i'm assuming there is) then the choices people have are take on a loan and repay an unfair amount back, or dont get an education. Its exploitative.",
Depth5_14,Depth4_27,But it should be if it will improve the level of workers for your country ,
Depth5_15,Depth4_27,"The student loan is a burden you have to carry throughout a lot of your professional and working life, which hinders your ability to live comfortably and puts pressure on individuals to find a good paying job",
Depth5_16,Depth4_40,Not everyone has the funds but everyone has the capability ,
Depth5_17,Depth4_40,The option to develop skills and better yourself should be easily accessible to everyone and not just people who think it will be easy to pay debt back ,
Depth5_18,Depth4_40,"University is a great place to learn, explore and discuss new ideas. Further education is good for society as a whole, not just in the job market. Learning to test and challenge things is imperative in.all areas of life and a is great skill. Its not just an individual investing in themselves for a return in high wages, its society investing in itself to become more progressive, equal and more understanding.",
Depth5_19,Depth4_40,Exactly therefore these higher risk jobs etc need expert training ,
Depth5_20,Depth4_40,"The UK is competing against highly trained and skilled individuals from across the world, so further education helps us compete and be at the forefront of industry advancement",
Depth5_21,Depth4_57,Not all parents can be relief funds ,
Depth5_22,Depth4_57,The government should be investing in the people instead of paying the politicians ridiculous salaries ,
Depth5_23,Depth4_57,"Everyone knows public services, including education, are stretched. But I think its fair to say quite a lot of money is also wasted ( brexit, mps expenses etc) It isnt a good arguement to try and prioritise the importance of services, they are all important. ",y
Depth5_24,Depth4_57,You could still have richer people make voluntary donations ,
Depth5_25,Depth4_57,"By putting money into education and supporting students who wish to gain a better education, we will have a more educated society who are less likely to be a government burden in the future (i.e. there should be less unemployed and healthier people)",
Depth5_26,Depth4_66,Everyone should be given a salary sacrifice after university to repay thr debts ,y
Depth5_27,Depth4_66,If people didn’t study these non vocational degrees then eventually there would be a shortage in skilled individuals that need these type of degrees to progress into other studies ,
Depth5_28,Depth4_66,"Jobs are not guarenteed, and its a little nieive to say that people who go to university will get a job in that area. There are not enough jobs, and with people having to work longer it makes getting a job really difficult. ",y
Depth5_29,Depth4_66,But education for our children should be top priority ,
Depth5_30,Depth4_66,"Having a creative and diverse society is essential to our economy that relies on numerous industries and skills. Making education free, regardless of the subject, allows us to produce people who are leaders in all fields, which helps our economy to flourish.",
Depth5_31,Depth4_3,The amount of money you have to make in a job to pay back tuition fees is too high for the average person. ,
Depth5_32,Depth4_3,University doesn’t not just provide academic knowledge it also teaches important life skills.,
Depth5_33,Depth4_3,"The UK is already investing money into new schemes that allow young people to develop technical and specific industry knowledge, for example through apprenticeships and the new T-Levels. These routes of education give young people an option to develop their knowledge without having to go to university and get a degree. ",
Depth5_34,Depth4_3,"That is an idea, but university courses also provide people with practical skills and so why not make these courses more accessible to everyone? ",
Depth5_35,Depth4_3,University degrees also allow people to gain practical experience and often have a year in industry which allows people to work as part of their degree ,
Depth5_36,Depth4_16,You also don't have to pay in Scotland. ,
Depth5_37,Depth4_16,NAN,
Depth5_38,Depth4_16,"Even with the increased cost to the individual, having free education provides individuals with an opportunity to attend university despite their socio-economic background. Therefore, social mobility continues to have momentum, unlike in the UK.",
Depth5_39,Depth4_16,"That is a valid point. However, abolishing university fees does not have to mean higher taxes. We need to look for ways that universities can source money from other means rather than putting students into crippling debt.",
Depth5_40,Depth4_16,This cost does not counteract the tuition fee cost of over £9000 per student per year though ,
Depth5_41,Depth4_29,It doesn't matter how low the interest is because most students won't pay back the amount owed. ,
Depth5_42,Depth4_29,The interest rate does not matter considering only the higher salaries repay anyway. It is just another tax.,
Depth5_43,Depth4_29,I don't think a 0% interest rate would be beneficial to the UK's economy but by lowering the interest rates I reckon it might help to boost the UK economy. ,
Depth5_44,Depth4_29,But is that even possible? Surely abolishing student fees would cut out the middle man and reduce the burden on every body. Why reduce the interest when you could just scrap them altogether?,
Depth5_45,Depth4_29,"But this still means that many students are in debt of nearly £30,000 just from their tuition fees alone ",
Depth5_46,Depth4_44,University at the very lest gives an excellent foundation into your particular field. ,
Depth5_47,Depth4_44,University also teaches important life skills.,
Depth5_48,Depth4_44,I don't believe university is just about getting a better job or a promotion. ,
Depth5_49,Depth4_44,"But we shouldn't be denying a university education to those who want it off the basis of financial needs. This creates amplifies so many problems with the economy in this country. If someone wants to go to university, they shouldn't have to worry about money!",
Depth5_50,Depth4_44,University allows people to explore a subject in a high level of depth and the independent study at university gives students depth and independence. Self motivation is developed,
Depth5_51,Depth4_61,The fees are so high only doctors and solicitors can afford to pay fees back ,
Depth5_52,Depth4_61,Some will abuse the support and use university as a way of delaying entering the working world.,
Depth5_53,Depth4_61,"Without student loans, many students would not be able to attend university and therefore would not have the opportunity to work hard to get their degree. Maybe we should have a more diverse stream of funding available to students.",
Depth5_54,Depth4_61,You can be determined to work hard and be dedicated yet not be in the position to cope with so much debt? Why are we putting a price on hard work?,
Depth5_55,Depth4_61,But is the student loan system fair? How does it affect people who have more than one sibling at university? How will people cope paying back their student loan in the future?,
Depth5_56,Depth4_77,It's still a monthly reduction on your wage for 30 years. You'll have student debt in your 50s. ,
Depth5_57,Depth4_77,It’s not just the loan amount in particular it’s the underlying anxiety of having debt hanging over them.,
Depth5_58,Depth4_77,Why is it unlikely? It is not guaranteed that everyone who has a degree will achieve a decent paid job. ,
Depth5_59,Depth4_77,But then what does that mean in the long run for the economy? Surely it would just make more sense to abolish the loan system altogether.,
Depth5_60,Depth4_77,"Many students do not get a big enough loan to live off and have to borrow more money from other sources, this will make them financially unstable in the future ",
Depth5_61,Depth4_7,Scholarships aren't readily available and why should someone have to apply for a scholarship instead of having the same qualifying opportunity as another student?,
Depth5_62,Depth4_7,"The government should fund university to allow that person to attend for free. Education is what improves the economic output of a country, especially one like the UK which has a service based economy.",
Depth5_63,Depth4_7,Scholarships are few and far between and only a very lucky few will be able to access this.,
Depth5_64,Depth4_7,Personnel can all afford to get a degree the school may be dependant if fees are abolished. If fees are abolished it allows all backgrounds to gain the same qualifications to the same standard just at different geographical locations.,
Depth5_65,Depth4_7,"Whilst that might be possible, that person is therefore not fully in control of their own destiny. Education should be available for people from all backgrounds and Scholarships will generally be limited in availability.",
Depth5_66,Depth4_19,NAN,
Depth5_67,Depth4_19,"True, but having a degree increases the education level of the population. Some will miss out if they have to afford to pay fees and we may be missing placing talented individuals into roles that they should be performing as they don't have the requisite level of qualification.",
Depth5_68,Depth4_19,It limits people in their choices and what they have to offer. Some really great minds maybe looked over due to not having the funds or the economic status .,
Depth5_69,Depth4_19,"That’s is leaning heavily dependant on an industrial economy growth. It will leave a poorer industry, who require qualified candidates wanting and restrictions on economical growth.",
Depth5_70,Depth4_19,I'm not entirely sure that's accurate. Quite the opposite. Scotland is a good comparative example back home. Higher education funding is made available for all students who earn under £25000.,
Depth5_71,Depth4_32,"So another student who's not as financially privileged but may commit to working just as hard if not harder towards their degree, cannot have access to the same opportunity without having an application for scholarship or fee waiver, what if both those applications are rejected?",
Depth5_72,Depth4_32,"Being saddled with debt when you have just left uni is not a great start to your working career. Abolishing fees means that education is open to all, not just those who can afford it.",
Depth5_73,Depth4_32,"The loan puts more pressure on the individual when they start their career. They should be concentrating on the new job, not on the repayments.",
Depth5_74,Depth4_32,The loans interest should only be due to inflation and loss to a bank or loan provider.,
Depth5_75,Depth4_32,I fail to understand your argument as to why specifically the brightest are afforded a fee waiver. No university should operate from the premise that the students with the best academic track record should have the easiest financial experience. That would only serve to widen the disparity.,
Depth5_76,Depth4_52,The degree provides an element of work experience in that field which can then be reflected upon during interview once the degree has been obtained!,
Depth5_77,Depth4_52,"Studying at uni equips people with higher level skills and thought processes. This should be made freely available to those who want it, rather than forcing debt onto students.",
Depth5_78,Depth4_52,You need to have some sort of qualification so people can be put in the right place/job. If there wasn't a degree then how would they prove they are capable to do the job.,
Depth5_79,Depth4_52,But all employment has it technological advancements and on hands work is not acceptable for the safety of workers. Like Doctors and Engineers this is safety and preservation of life by safety cautions and correctly trained individuals.,
Depth5_80,Depth4_52,"Work experience is vital and invaluable in many trades. Apprenticeships are a perfect example of how you learn by doing. However, many other career paths require that new staff firstly arm themselves with a strong academic awareness of the subject. Whilst you may learn to be a Carpenter by practice, you certainly couldn't apply the same approach to being a Surgeon.",
Depth5_81,Depth4_62,The government should have a substantial amount set aside to invest in University fees as its investing in the future of the country!,
Depth5_82,Depth4_62,Some people are entirley put off by the idea that you end up in debt at the end of a degree. This stops talented people from attending and adds to a general brain drain in the UK.,y
Depth5_83,Depth4_62,The loan needs to be paid back regardless and not all graduates can get a high paying job. They are only so many jobs out there. Some graduates end up struggling to pay the loan and live too.,
Depth5_84,Depth4_62,"Not all employments will pay highly, but need educated personnel to fulfil the roles such as public sector employment. ",y
Depth5_85,Depth4_62,"Universities do not gain funding directly from student loan fees. Rather, they are afforded funding levels from the Government bodies based on a secured number of student placements each term. The investment aspect runs deeper, in so much as the Government is investing with the University to produce a higher calibre of educated workforce. It is not an individual investment.",
Depth5_86,Depth4_78,"University should be accessible to all, not just he silver spoon students!",
Depth5_87,Depth4_78,Taking a loan is encouraging people to continue this behaviour during their working life. It's just continuing to make bankers wealthier at the expense of others. Fees should be abolished to open education up to all.,
Depth5_88,Depth4_78,They're not that many job opportunities that pay a good wage that you don't have to go to university to get. A degree is what employers are looking for to even get an interview. ,
Depth5_89,Depth4_78,All individuals should be entitled to further education and the opportunity needs to be available for all no matter what their monetary background. ,
Depth5_90,Depth4_78,"The cost of putting a student through University need not be met by the student. The devolved Goverments within the UK have direct budgetary control over various aspects of their respective countries and can pool finances from other areas to fund education. They are seeing the larger picture that by removing the financial barriers to higher education provides the scope for citizens to improve themselves and become more productive members of society. Whilst University may not be a right as such, there should be no political barriers to prevent entry.",y
Depth5_91,Depth4_92,It is not good setting someone up with a life long debt before they even embark on a career. ,
Depth5_92,Depth4_92,Many young people have been brought up to feel that university is necessary . There are also very few alternatives.,
Depth5_93,Depth4_92,"I think fee's should be abolished, we should not have to pay to have access to higher education",
Depth5_94,Depth4_92,"Although education as a step to future employment is important, aspiring to education as an end of its own is also a valid reason. In such a case the achievements, discoveries and overall well-being to society gained from having an educated populace must not be underestimated.",
Depth5_95,Depth4_92,"Students are in debt after graduating, including students who were in accommodation and international students as the total money they have to pay back (student loan) is very high. They have to pay off the loan when their salary reaches a certain amount",
Depth5_96,Depth4_102,The fees payable should be abolished and students advised to pay they same sum into a savings account for a property that they could own. ,
Depth5_97,Depth4_102,Scholarships are not available to all and are not sustainable for all.,
Depth5_98,Depth4_102,It should be a right to free higher education so that we can learn and grow as individuals and better our communities and lives.,
Depth5_99,Depth4_102,"It's clear that the system of grants and scholarships worked in the past, and it's only short-sighted politics that have led to the current situation. It worked once; it can work again.",
Depth5_100,Depth4_102,"Not everyone can get scholarships offered by the government as they do not meet the requirements, such as individuals that are not as intelligent and so do not perform well enough to get high achievement scholarships or individuals that are from households with average income so are not eligible for bursaries",
Depth5_101,Depth4_109,Why should a poor person have to do that? Everyone should have equal rights and it should be fair ,
Depth5_102,Depth4_109,"Often loans are not enough to live off nowadays, it also reduces the quality of life once they gave a job.",
Depth5_103,Depth4_109,"But then that poor person has the burden of paying off a loan in the future, that is something that no one should ever have to worry about. If no one had to pay then we would all be much smarter and be much more able to pursue our career goals.",
Depth5_104,Depth4_109,"This once again presupposes that the function of education is to lead to lucrative employment. Who's to guarantee that great discoveries won't be made by an educated but relatively low-paid individual. We risk urging people towards a career-driven path, thus avoiding the possibilities of pure research.",
Depth5_105,Depth4_109,"A poor person will still have to pay interest on top of the student loan and the starting salary for a medic is similar to many other jobs, so they will not be better off than a person who has a higher household salary",
Depth5_106,Depth4_120,Yes they would. Before they even start in their chosen career they are in debt. ,
Depth5_107,Depth4_120,"No, although they will take home less than rheir well off counterparts when they do get a high paying job.",y
Depth5_108,Depth4_120,Yes they would B1. The financial burden takes its toll on people and it isnt easy having a looming debt which you know you will have to pay off eventually and sacrifice for.,
Depth5_109,Depth4_120,I don't think you can comment on what 'young people' would or would not do. Just because you wouldn't hold back from this means nothing.,
Depth5_110,Depth4_120,"Due to the low starting salaries of jobs and the high interest on the student loans, even students with good salary jobs will take time to pay off the student loans, therefore they will have lost several years of their salary in the process",
Depth5_111,Depth4_132,The fees should be stopped altogether as putting people in large amounts of debt based on career choice is not good financial stability ,
Depth5_112,Depth4_132,"Only the brightest and the best get scholarships, they should not be the only people who can get one.",
Depth5_113,Depth4_132,"Its bad for the economy and it makes sense to offer free education if the provided the government can do so, which i think they can",
Depth5_114,Depth4_132,"There's little evidence to show that such a measure would achieve anything, nor indeed be fairly distributed. A non-egalitarian policy would be fairer and ultimately better for society.",
Depth5_115,Depth4_132,"Not everyone is eligible for scholarships, therefore instead the university fees should be scrapped or money off schemes should be started so that students from poorer families can go to university",

Depth5_117,Depth4_139,"There are many jobs that you can only get with a degree, most professional high paying jobs require a degree. ",
Depth5_118,Depth4_139,But with free higher education no one is limited and they can pursue any career they want with the help of free university. There are no limits.,
Depth5_119,Depth4_139,"I think I made this argument earlier, but in the context of urging pure scholars towards a career-based path. Education should be open to all, and the benefit to society as a result is the payment.",
Depth5_120,Depth4_139,"Prices for essential products around the world are increasing, the population is increasing and therefore if an individual has better job, they are more likely to be successful in the real world as they are more prepared, where there is increased rate of debt",
Depth5_121,Depth4_95,What evidence do you have to support this? ,
Depth5_122,Depth4_95,It would benefit the government far more by more people completing university and the them getting higher jobs therefore helping unemployment rates and contribution back to the country.,
Depth5_123,Depth4_95,Yes but keeping the fees will take longer to pay off and will be extranomical. It will put the student in debt so is better if it is abolished so that the student can get a good job with higher earnings so they can contribute to the taxes,y
Depth5_124,Depth4_95,Abolish fees so University is open to every one. Increase Income tax by 2p per month to cover this cost.,
Depth5_125,Depth4_95,Having education will enable for people to access better paying jobs,
Depth5_126,Depth4_104,The more people who have the opportunity to education the more competitive the job market will be and therefore the more people in employment and paying taxes ,
Depth5_127,Depth4_104,Everyone should be entitled to further education. Raising tax not the answer.,
Depth5_128,Depth4_104,No that is not for the government to increase taxes just for the sake of education.,
Depth5_129,Depth4_104,More educated people will have higher paid jobs and in return will pay more tax which will cover the abolishment of uni fees,
Depth5_130,Depth4_104,Student debt can put people off from continuing with education,
Depth5_131,Depth4_110,"I agree, however it's really important that everyone has the option to go to university so that the individual can decide what route they'd like to take ",
Depth5_132,Depth4_110,You could have the smartest kid but they live in poverty family they could be a fine doctor but can’t afford the fees.,
Depth5_133,Depth4_110,"True but if the student has the ability to go to university and their background is impoverished, how will he or she be able to afford the fees. ",
Depth5_134,Depth4_110,"A lot of careers still need a degree, teachers, doctors, etc. Abolishing fees will open university for everyone.",
Depth5_135,Depth4_110,You can’t become a doctor without a degree,

Depth5_137,Depth4_123,Slow it down a bit make it voluntary to pay back ,
Depth5_138,Depth4_123,"Yes but if the fees are not intact, the student will be able to earn a big wage without being saddled with debt whether they are rich or poor.",
Depth5_139,Depth4_123,Not having to pay anything back will attract more people to apply for university,
Depth5_140,Depth4_123,Everyone has different financial commitments,
Depth5_141,Depth4_134,The citizen doesn't get a choice with other taxes?,
Depth5_142,Depth4_134,It will be better for the he economy if everyone was to receive further eductation ,y
Depth5_143,Depth4_134,Yes but at least through the citizen it would not be so high on taxes and it would be for the benefit for the students who cannot afford the fees.,
Depth5_144,Depth4_134,Make university fees cheaper and tax only slightly higher,
Depth5_145,Depth4_134,Having more students will create a better workforce,
Depth5_146,Depth4_142,Students should be encouraged to carry out volunteer work ,
Depth5_147,Depth4_142,Add In the option In degrees for work experience year that way get theory and experience ,
Depth5_148,Depth4_142,Young people with a degree will be able to start their own businesses if there is a gap in the job market. ,
Depth5_149,Depth4_142,Introduce more work experience whilst undertaking a degree so that the graduate has some experience when applying for jobs,
Depth5_150,Depth4_142,Nan,
Depth5_151,Depth4_96,A loan can leave someone with a crippling amount of debt. In many cases the government ends up writing off student loans in any event. If students have more disposable income then they can reinvest that back into the economy.,
Depth5_152,Depth4_96,"I agree, use the higher taxes on the health care system",
Depth5_153,Depth4_96,"Because starting your life with a large loan causes difficulty when trying to buy or rent a house. Whilst you might be more likely to get jobs that pay more, this isn't guarenteed and therefore you might be restrained on where you can live and therefore not be able to put your education to best use. Also careers such as doctors etc, which require longer studies, might put off students who can not afford to get loans but their studies benefit the entire society.",y
Depth5_154,Depth4_96,"More people feeling able to study further creates better education across society, and paying by tax means the loans aren't placed upon the student all at once.",
Depth5_155,Depth4_96,"If students didnt have to pay fees they would be fresher and keener to take jobs at a lower level which offer progression in what they've qualified to do in rather than taking any available jobs which other people could do, ensuring a better spread of employment. ",
Depth5_156,Depth4_108,The goal that they should have in mind is completing their degree and then using that to find a good job. ,
Depth5_157,Depth4_108,"They could use the equivalent money to get a mortgage, not saddled with the debt",
Depth5_158,Depth4_108,"Very few things in life are free, but you shouldn't be made to take certain jobs or stay in certain jobs simply because you need to pay a loan back. It will reduce the amount of people who can work in the public sector, if working in the private sector is the only means of paying back the loan and starting your own life.",
Depth5_159,Depth4_108,Saddling students who do not have the bank of mum and dad to rely on with huge debt does nothing but reduce the respect a degree deserves. It only helps the rich get richer.,
Depth5_160,Depth4_108,"But if university education is available to people regardless of their ability to pay or need to take a loan, tbere woukd be a wider choice of candidate and places given to tjose who really want them",
Depth5_161,Depth4_115,What if they are refused a loan due to their financial circumstances or are not eligible for a scholarship? Those people should still be entitled to go to University if they achieve adequate results at school.,
Depth5_162,Depth4_115,"Paying off debt whilst starting out in a career, what chance of they getting on the property ladder",
Depth5_163,Depth4_115,There are too few scholarships and they often fall sort of covering the true costs. Scholarships then push the burden of choosing who can go to university onto the universities or charities that provide the funding. Having to fight for funding aswell as academic entry requirements is adding another barrier to student potentially from a disadvantaged background who has many barriers to overcome to be able to consider going onto higher education.,
Depth5_164,Depth4_115,Scholarships are few and far between. Just because someone doesn't come from a rich family doesn't mean they deserve to be saddled with huge debts for the rest of their life.,
Depth5_165,Depth4_115,"It is unfair to expect everyone to have funds available or enough family support to pay fees, there could be some good and much needed medics lost this way ",
Depth5_166,Depth4_126,If it means that the better paid job would leave them with less money after the loan deductions are taken into account they may well apply for the lower paid job. ,
Depth5_167,Depth4_126,"The loans get written off after a period of time, inflated by inflation, why have the debt to start with ",
Depth5_168,Depth4_126,"If the pay difference is less than the loan amount, then you would be worse off accepting the higher paid job. It might not be a case of not wanting the higher paid job, or promotion, if in reality it will mean a lower take home pay, it might not affordable in the short term to accept it, even if in the long term it makes more sense.",
Depth5_169,Depth4_126,"Yet if someone is just below the 21,000 salary mark, they would be much less likely to go for a promotion or take on extra work if they have large student loans",
Depth5_170,Depth4_126,Which is why i said that making university education available to more people regadless of financial status us will encourage dedicated people see through their education and be prepared to work their way up in the job they are qualified to do. ,y
Depth5_171,Depth4_136,"Loans only benefit the banking system in the form of interest payments which could otherwise have been spent by the student on food, clothes, cars etc which would be directly invested into the economy. The UK already has record levels of debt so adding additional student debt just exacerbates the situation.",
Depth5_172,Depth4_136,"The fees put off people from poorest backgrounds, it's only the rich that can afford it",

Depth5_261,Depth4_177,"For many young people in less fortunate financial situations, they may not have the opportunity to ever ""build the required financial background"" they need to take out a loan.

Depth5_282,Depth4_223,It was free when i was a student so this is wrong. Why should the new generation be denied the opportunities that were offered to me?,
Depth5_283,Depth4_235,The loan does not account for the living cost at some universities.,
Depth5_284,Depth4_235,That may only be sufficient to cover the cost of the degree and no living costs. If student fees were abolished and a student needed to take out a loan they could use that money to pay for their living costs and continue with the degree.,
Depth5_285,Depth4_235,"However, some people may never be able to get a job to pay off their debts due to varying circumstances. They will have to live with this burden on their shoulders for the rest of their lives. ",
Depth5_286,Depth4_235,"For students who live at home, the loan is based off of parent income and if their parents earn relatively good income, they receive less loan regardless of whether their parents help the, financially. This means that loans do not necessarily cover costs that students need them to and they must find employment or leave their course. ",
Depth5_287,Depth4_235,You are then encouraging people to live beyond their means and face a long term debt. The cost of housing is another burden to young people leaving university and it can all seem too much.,
Depth5_288,Depth4_245,"You can not rely on people getting well paid jobs in order to pay off the loans. Also, these people have no duty to try and get those jobs, they may enjoy the jobs they have. ",
Depth5_289,Depth4_245,A degree no longer ensures that someone will end up in a high paying job. Many graduates with degrees end up in low paid work in the current economy which has never fully recovered since the financial crisis.,
Depth5_290,Depth4_245,"That is true, but just because somebody has a degree (with a lot of debt) doesn't mean they will necessarily get a good job. They could still end up working in retail as a customer assistant, just one with a degree. Also, if they decide to go for a non-traditional degree it doesn't mean that they will get more opportunities.",
Depth5_291,Depth4_245,"As other routes into work become more popular, simply having a degree is not enough and some people compete against competitors who have more experience due to not attending uni. This makes it harder for people to get into their chosen field. ",

Depth5_294,Depth4_256,That has nothing to do with the original argument that a student may never pay back their loan which will result in it being written off by the government. ,
Depth5_295,Depth4_256,"Quite often you will find that public schools have low grades, as do poorer schools. Does this mean that poor people are not worthy of going to university and getting their own independence and studying what they want? There is no reason that we should have to force people to try and get perfect grades so they don't have to pay as much in debt. It's ridiculously unfair especially to people with learning difficulties.",
Depth5_296,Depth4_256,"Some people struggle to settle into university and not everyone gets top grades from the outset, meaning slow learners and those who need the money most may miss out. ",
Depth5_297,Depth4_256,A lot of people never fully pay back the loan and some have no intention of doing so. The government has to allow for these losses and the administrative time involved in running the loan system.,
Depth5_298,Depth4_269,"You cannot do this! You cannot make paying for university contingent on people being able to work while studying, or getting scholarships, or any of that. People need access, they need to be treated equitably, and not be judged on talent which is subjective and unhelpful anyway.",
Depth5_299,Depth4_269,Scholarships are relatively rare and very few students are likely to be eligible for one. Who is funding these scholarships in any event and what is to stop them being withdrawn in the future? If the student has to work then they will not have sufficient time to devote to their studies and might not be able to complete their course.,
Depth5_300,Depth4_269,"Again so you're saying a student has to be exceptional to be worth anything? There are more average people that will not get scholarships and even if someone is good at something, it doesn't mean they will make the requirements for the scholarship. Trying to balance a job with university life isn't realistic. Especially when you would have to have multiple jobs to try to keep up with the loans.",
Depth5_301,Depth4_269,"The scholarships are awarded for unique excellence, meaning they are not open to the majority which places many students at a disadvantage. It is those who therefore may need to put in a bit more work that would be required to find jobs, something that they may not have time for as they are trying to keep grades up as well.",
Depth5_302,Depth4_269,There are not enough scholarships and foundations for all talented students. For potential students who have come from a background where finances are a constant source of stress the loan system may be seen as another financial debt stressor.,y
Depth5_303,Depth4_279,"The government have a responsibility, it is not up to banks, it should not be.",
Depth5_304,Depth4_279,Banks would likely impose even higher rates of interest which would be unsustainable and they may also reject a large number of students given their financial circumstances. ,
Depth5_305,Depth4_279,The government should lower their own unnecessarily high paycheck to be able to afford the loans they are giving out. Banks would prey on young students not understanding the larger terms they use to try and trick people into paying more than they should. To expect banks to pay for university loans is a strange idea. If someone is educated didn't you say they would have more opportunities? Of course that's not true but a lot of people with degrees don't get a high paying job if they are even hired in the first place.,
Depth5_306,Depth4_279,NAN ,
Depth5_307,Depth4_279,I don’t think that the banks would approve loans to everyone that the government supports as they wouldn’t be prepared to take the risk. This would make a university education less available.,

Depth5_309,Depth4_290,"No, it just means that more people are working hard at school and have the ambition to acheive more in life. A desire to achieve a good education is not linked to someone's financial means.",y
Depth5_310,Depth4_290,Many people do not come from middle class/rich families. Just because there are more people doesn't mean they can afford it. ,
Depth5_311,Depth4_290,"More jobs rely on having a degree, meaning it isn’t seen as worthwhile to get one. However, many people struggle financially through uni and fight to maintain a job.",
Depth5_312,Depth4_290,Personal debt can have huge negative consequences in a person’s life. It is not a habit that we should be encouraging. If a person is intelligent enough to go to university they should have the opportunity to do so and to reap the benefits.,
Depth5_313,Depth4_236,University fees negatively discriminate against potential students who are unable to fund their studies and living costs. The finance provided to these students is not sufficient to allow them to complete their studies. ,
Depth5_314,Depth4_236,If uni fees were abolished then there would be less worry about paying off student loans and any extra income earned could go toward living and studying expenses. ,

Depth5_320,Depth4_251,A student loan isnt like a normal loan where it is not based on income therefore i dont think its that big of a deal,
Depth5_321,Depth4_251,"Surely it would be more beneficial to the government to lower tuition fees and guarantee that they will get the money back, rather than not knowing how much will be paid back by each person",
Depth5_322,Depth4_251,I don't agree that the government doesn't expect to get their money back. I have not paid a penny back in the 15 years since I graduated and I don't intend to on principle now so no one wins.,
Depth5_323,Depth4_267,Many parents and therefore their children will lack the knowledge to help them make the correct financial choices,
Depth5_324,Depth4_267,"Doing away with uni fees would give everyone an equal chance of getting into uni, it would not depend on your financial situation of your parents and what they have done in the past. ",
Depth5_325,Depth4_267,I think the parents should encourage it and the loan teaches about budgeting and managing money,
Depth5_326,Depth4_267,"There are stigmas against loans, and many people see them as a bad thing, so in creating a loan, it means that a group of society who oppose loans, will be removed from those able and willing to go to university",
Depth5_327,Depth4_267,I've barely known anyone whose parents went to uni and most of the friends I grew up with in a small town never went to uni either.,
Depth5_328,Depth4_271,The current labour market and according salary does not provide for most students to pay their loan back. This is made worse by the high interest rate,
Depth5_329,Depth4_271,Getting rid of uni fees means that people will be able to do courses without the stress of having to pay loans back and they are able to put in minimal effort for maximum reward. ,
Depth5_330,Depth4_271,The income is based on earnings so its all calculated based on earnings,
Depth5_331,Depth4_271,"That's a very narrow minded argument, and one that does not take into consideration the different opportunities that people are faced with. A ""well paid job"" often comes as the result of who you or your parents know and your social connections, rather than just hard work.",
Depth5_332,Depth4_271,It's very easy to get into a uni these days and many people go for the experience and thus don't necessarily get well paid jobs and then don't pay the loans back. ,
Depth5_333,Depth4_287,Higher education ensures that the economy is skilled enough to develop. ,
Depth5_334,Depth4_287,Uni fees should be done away with and taxes should be increased slightly so as to increase the money the government receives without affecting society too much. ,
Depth5_335,Depth4_287,I dont think it should be down to taxes to raise it otherwise its not fair on others,
Depth5_336,Depth4_287,"It is in the government's best interest to enable as many young people access to university as possible, having no loans would increase the number of students attending university and therefore, decrease the number of those who were affected my paying higher tax and not going to university. ",
Depth5_337,Depth4_287,Then it might encourage parts of society that have historically not gone to uni to go uni to go and take advantage whilst the upper classes can pay more tax and it can be a bonus for the lower classes.,
Depth5_338,Depth4_291,Students from low income families and minority groups struggle to access education and the funding routes available to them. The student loan process is complex and not fully explained.,
Depth5_339,Depth4_292,Getting rid of uni fees means that people can do a uni course purely for interest not because they want to get a high paying job in that field and pay back the loan. ,
Depth5_340,Depth4_293,Agree with b1 and the open university is always an option,
Depth5_341,Depth4_294,NAN,
Depth5_342,Depth4_295,There are also more people dropping out than ever even mature students and I have had first hand experience of this and seeing single mature mothers struggling and dropping out when all they want is to better their family's lives,
Depth5_343,Depth4_238,Scotland don’t have to pay for student fees at all despite living in the UK which is unfair,
Depth5_344,Depth4_238,To work and study at the same time is never going to work unless it was working in an environment to which the course the student was taking,
Depth5_345,Depth4_238,However the stress of managing debt is an additional burden that students are unable to deal with,
Depth5_346,Depth4_238,Given the current economy and the likelyhood of Brexit to be approved we cannot be sure that employment would be enough for our population,y
Depth5_347,Depth4_238,"Students have a hard enough time with the study /work balance without also having to pay for education. Most students still need to pay for their utility bills, food & rent. Adding fee’s to this increases the hours a student needs to work to cover this therefore giving students less time to study and complete their course to an adequate level.",
Depth5_348,Depth4_253,People are not going to university because they can’t afford to attend and there families are unable to financially support them,
Depth5_349,Depth4_253,The government wastes money like there's no tommorrow giving free education could get better people running the country,y
Depth5_350,Depth4_253,So its a debt on society rather than the individual who benefits?,
Depth5_351,Depth4_253,Some loans are impossible to pay and the student carries it with it for several years,
Depth5_352,Depth4_253,By making university fee’s free the UK will have a higher percentage of skilled/qualified workers. This in turn being higher earners who pay more tax.,
Depth5_353,Depth4_268,Teenagers might not pursue the career they want because they are talked out of taking a loan out,
Depth5_354,Depth4_268,The parent will not want to see there offspring get into debt,
Depth5_355,Depth4_268,"Debt remains a stigma amongst those without financial means, society should not be encouraging such practice",
Depth5_356,Depth4_268,Not all parents have the solvency to help their children,
Depth5_357,Depth4_268,Making university fee’s free is one less burden to consider making it much easier for people to attend in the first place.,
Depth5_358,Depth4_273,Some families can’t support their child to go to uni because they have to provide money before they even receive there loan which can put a massive strain on families,
Depth5_359,Depth4_273,A student who's willing to put up the money to get going will study hard regardless,
Depth5_360,Depth4_273,Graduates should be in a position to earn more and therefore better able to repay the loan,
Depth5_361,Depth4_273,Paying its actually an incentive to not even going to university in the first place,
Depth5_362,Depth4_273,Free university fee’s gives our country more qualified and professional workers who will pay back society by passing on knowledge and of course paying a higher rate of tax.,
Depth5_363,Depth4_288,"You need degrees for professions such as a doctor which provide good to the country, surely the service they provide should be good enough to pay slightly higher taxes",
Depth5_364,Depth4_288,I would much prefer a free university than handouts to illegal refugees ,
Depth5_365,Depth4_288,Improving the whole of society through cheaper education funded by higher taxes benefits the many rather than the few,
Depth5_366,Depth4_288,a true value of a country relies on their educated population,
Depth5_367,Depth4_288,There are certain sectors of the NHS that are desperate for trained professionals which we don’t seem to have enough of. Making university free could increase the amount of doctors and nurses we have in this country.,
Depth5_368,Depth4_292,"People don’t have access to the same possibilities such as university because they can’t even afford to go, such as having to pay deposits and the right equipment needed for university ",
Depth5_369,Depth4_292,The government should be making sure our children don't end up in debt before they even got on the working ladder,
Depth5_370,Depth4_292,"Yes, but it remains a choice, and those that pursue a higher education should bear the brunt ",
Depth5_371,Depth4_292,No fees offers financial freedom ,
Depth5_372,Depth4_292,A disadvantaged person could be changed into an advantaged one just by doing one simple thing - making university fee’s free ! A true gift to empower people.,
Depth5_373,Depth4_295,Some people have higher paying jobs most the majority dont,
Depth5_374,Depth4_295,"Highly educated citizens are a public good, so providing univeristy courses are providing high added value, it is worthwhile using public spending to fund degrees.",
Depth5_375,Depth4_295,Yes,
Depth5_376,Depth4_295,Some people leave University and do not obtain a higher paying job despite having gained a degree. They are then saddled with a debt that they might never be able to repay.,
Depth5_377,Depth4_295,A small individual increase in tax would not effect the lifestyle of the working class/professional workforce and if anything would provide a more educated workforce as a whole. ,
Depth5_378,Depth4_303,That would put more burden on the student having less time to study,
Depth5_379,Depth4_303,Students should be able to focus on their studies rather than having to worry about paying for fees,
Depth5_380,Depth4_303,They should keep it as it can help with jobs for young people,
Depth5_381,Depth4_303,I agree that it is good for students to have part time jobs while studying but there are times during a degree when the workload is such that there isn't any spare time to keep a part time job.,
Depth5_382,Depth4_303,Taking time away from studies can cause difficulties with students grasping the core content of a professional role as well as part time work being sparse and unreliable for the most part.,
Depth5_383,Depth4_315,There are only a certain amount of better higher paying jobs so even if your argument was valid there will always be some that can't get the job they want,y
Depth5_384,Depth4_315,The need to repay loans once income reaches a certain level could act as a disintentive for graduates to get ahead.,
Depth5_385,Depth4_315,They are a hard loan but it still makes people want to persevere,
Depth5_386,Depth4_315,"Even those with good degrees can struggle to find a well paid job and some work in sectors that pay less, for example charities or social enterprises.",
Depth5_387,Depth4_315,A student from a working class/poorer family cannot afford to gamble with their future on the off chance that they may or may not land a professional role directly after university.,
Depth5_388,Depth4_325,If they haven't the resources they won't stand a chance of getting a better job and pay,
Depth5_389,Depth4_325,"If they are dissuaded from taking up a place at univeristy because of the cost, the whole nation loses the skills they would have learned.",y
Depth5_390,Depth4_325,If they have a poor background they should find a job that will accept them in,
Depth5_391,Depth4_325,It may indeed help them to get a better job but that is not guaranteed and no one knows what the future holds.,
Depth5_392,Depth4_325,Higher education should not be gated by financial constraints as this does not breed new ideas and diversity.,
Depth5_393,Depth4_336,A student shouldn't have to weigh up there options if they got their heart set on something then they should be given the chance to succeed,
Depth5_394,Depth4_336,"They should have a range of options, and base their decision on what is best for their career development without having to factor in cost.",
Depth5_395,Depth4_336,Yet again it may make them give up but it may make them persevere aswell,y
Depth5_396,Depth4_336,Many degrees don't lead automatically to a job but if it is an area that a student is particularly interested they will have more motivation to study and obtain a good degree.,
Depth5_397,Depth4_336,"Jobs and salaries are not the olny reason why someone would attend university i.e research, self expression etc",y
Depth5_398,Depth4_341,Not everyone can do or be in a position to study abroad take on a part time job and study and there will only be a limited funds and scholarship s,
Depth5_399,Depth4_341,Scholarships are unfortunately in short supply and other those most gifted are able to access them,
Depth5_400,Depth4_341,The child from the poor background can get s small job and be able to pay for the degree ,
Depth5_401,Depth4_341,No one should be excluded from attending University because of financial restraints.,
Depth5_402,Depth4_341,A degree may not be for everyone but access the university level education and information should be and gating this behind an arbitrary pay wall is absurd and backwards.,
Depth5_403,Depth4_298,"Some people have alot of debt from a younger age therefore they stuggle month to month paying that back, which then means they couldnt afford to take on more debt such as university funds",y
Depth5_404,Depth4_298,They still in debt and will have this hanging over them for years to come,
Depth5_405,Depth4_298,"The existance of the debt acts like a millstone round their neck, regardless of whether they are currently earning enough to repay.",y
Depth5_406,Depth4_298,People shouldn’t settle for small salaries they should want the bigger salaries from the harder degrees and that means more of the money will be taken through loans,
Depth5_407,Depth4_298,I have known student debt to ruin peoples lives for years so it isnt worth it,
Depth5_408,Depth4_308,A degree may not be a right but some people may be desperate for one but have no ways to afford it. I dont think people should lose out on going to university just because of their financial issues,
Depth5_409,Depth4_308,Some people don't have a choice ,
Depth5_410,Depth4_308,"University should be accessible to all those who are capable of going, and univerisity is a public good that benefits all",y
Depth5_411,Depth4_308,If no one did the degrees you wouldn’t have had a teacher to have taught you to write that paragraph ,
Depth5_412,Depth4_308,Students shouldn't have this argument with themselves knowing that if they want a degree etc they have to get into debt so it isnt really an option,
Depth5_413,Depth4_318,Its not that easy to get a job ,
Depth5_414,Depth4_318,No they wouldn't as they still be on a low paid job,
Depth5_415,Depth4_318,"Tax rates need not rise to pay for tuition. If more people going to univeristy raises the human capital of the nation, economic growth with increase, meaning tax receipts go up without the need to increase tax rates",y
Depth5_416,Depth4_318,The less paid people are probably doing the easier degrees ,
Depth5_417,Depth4_318,Not all students that finish university end up with a good job I have known students who have a degree but cannot get a job,
Depth5_418,Depth4_327,B1 sounds like they have everhthing handed to them on a plate and dont know the real struggles of life,y
Depth5_419,Depth4_327,In turn getting themselves into debt,
Depth5_420,Depth4_327,Students from poorer backgrounds are already at a disadvantage to those from richer ones. Getting into further debt just exacerbates that.,
Depth5_421,Depth4_327,"Rubbish, you could have rich parents but they might not help towards your uni fees and you wouldn’t be entitled to any maintenance payments. That’s not fair on those people ",
Depth5_422,Depth4_327,People shouldn't have to do all that to be educated further. When they are toddlers parents or children don't have an option they have to go to school so why should it be oh we'll fund your education till you are 18 but then you have to get into debt to continue. The government and education systems start this so they should finish it,
Depth5_423,Depth4_338,What about someone who might not have the best academic results when they wete younger and decide to go to university later on in life,y
Depth5_424,Depth4_338,Students and families do worry ,
Depth5_425,Depth4_338,Suitable jobs that fit around your studies are hard to come by and will necessarily leave less time for study.,
Depth5_426,Depth4_338,You will be worried because the loan is constantly increasing and even when the payments start to go down it never really will be because of the constant compounding interest ,
Depth5_427,Depth4_338,Students surely shouldn't have this worry over their heads I have known a student to commit suicide because of the debt they are in so I will never agree,
Depth5_428,Depth4_343,Once again its not that easy to get a job. ,
Depth5_429,Depth4_343,A part time job would affect the students studies,
Depth5_430,Depth4_343,Needing to get a job will take the person's focus off their studies and they may not do as well.,
Depth5_431,Depth4_343,A part time job might not pay for expenses living in expensive areas like London ,
Depth5_432,Depth4_343,There are no sacrifices big enough to afford these loans ,
Depth5_433,Depth4_301,"The interest and fees are lifelong for many students. It would be a burden for anyone to have a lifelong, large loan.",
Depth5_434,Depth4_301,Only the few who end up with higher paying jobs with will be able to pay back without affecting there day to day living,
Depth5_435,Depth4_301,"Whilst that is true, the loans are means assessed based on the parents’ income, which doesn’t take into account whether the parents are actually going to be offering any financial support, so the loans are not fairly given out in the first place. ",
Depth5_436,Depth4_301,Students tend to look to those before them and see that many are still in debt after a few years of graduating thus hindering them from taking loans for a business.,
Depth5_437,Depth4_301,"In order to have a representative view of society in positions that can have the most influence, the barriers to higher education should be reduced where we can. Many simply cannot afford the luxury of taking out a loan to be paid back at any point when that money would need to be spent on their families. ",
Depth5_438,Depth4_312,NAN,
Depth5_439,Depth4_312,Without having to pay back a loan ,
Depth5_440,Depth4_312,"But what if someone gets a lower paid, but really worthwhile job - such as primary school teacher, nurse, or charity worker - all of which often require a degree but are terribly underpaid as a sector? ",
Depth5_441,Depth4_312,"Then the debt will stay will stay with them forever, thus making less ambitious.",
Depth5_442,Depth4_312,"BA degrees now are a lot less worthy than they were before. For top jobs you’re looking at a Masters. To put barriers in the way of a standard degree course widens the gap in society. If they have the ability and the inclination, they should be enabled to achieve what those in more privileged positions are able to do. ",
Depth5_443,Depth4_321,Seeking a degree abroad should not be what we are encouraging our students to do. We could lose great talent once they study and then settle abroad.,
Depth5_444,Depth4_321,There are limited number of these and it so not viable for everyone,
Depth5_445,Depth4_321,"Scholarships and fee waivers are incredibly competitive and often don’t take into account the cost of living, only fees. Plus, if brexit happens, other EU countries won’t be a cheaper alternative for UK residents. ",
Depth5_446,Depth4_321,Not every person wants to relocate to a foreign environment specially if language is different.,
Depth5_447,Depth4_321,"This is the view of a sheltered individual. Many have caring responsibilities, some have families, the cost of living abroad is still more expensive than living with parents and travelling to do your degree. For it to be worth anything to a potential employer it would have to be recognised as a decent university as well. Otherwise the effort is for nought. Not everyone is eligible for scholarships and there are a limited number of waivers / cash for subsidies available. University needs to be more accessible not less.",
Depth5_448,Depth4_330,your argument (A2),
Depth5_449,Depth4_330,A loan puts unnecessary pressure on students and is not a precursor for motivation. Students must be self motivated to do well.,
Depth5_450,Depth4_330,Being in debt leads to other issues like mental well being,
Depth5_451,Depth4_330,"All research shows that debt adds a huge amount of stress to the debtor - there are no mental benefits really, I don’t think that it would help their focus, only hinder it. ",
Depth5_452,Depth4_330,That depends on the current economic climate and the degree the person is perusing.,
Depth5_453,Depth4_330,"A loan isn’t good for a student, we’re agreed. The debt doesn’t impact how much the student learns, other than if they’re working / stressing about how they can afford the loan, they are focussed on that and not the primary purpose of them being there - to learn. ",y
Depth5_454,Depth4_339,"Once the student gets a job, the amount repayable may be significant depending on the salary, it could have huge impacts on lifestyle.",
Depth5_455,Depth4_339,Some people may never be in ap position to pay it back,
Depth5_456,Depth4_339,"The loan is means assessed (based on parental income) but is limited in how well it reflects the support parents can actually offer, and so the awarded loan amount often falls far short of the fee and living costs. ",
Depth5_457,Depth4_339,Then that will be a debt that stays with person hindering the person from getting others loans.,
Depth5_458,Depth4_339,"Except it isn’t! Some children have already discounted going to university before they’re even eligible due to the associated cost, when they can be helping to bring money into the family rather than burden themselves with debt they have no guarantee of paying off.",
Depth5_459,Depth4_349,NAN,
Depth5_460,Depth4_349,It is also being part of a citizen to have a right to free education regardless,
Depth5_461,Depth4_349,"What about key workers like nurses and midwives who have to have a degree level education in order to work in those jobs, but there are now no subsidies or bursaries available? Why not increase tax to cover university education? ",
Depth5_462,Depth4_349,Government spending on foreign policy is to high to justify it as being a citizen.,
Depth5_463,Depth4_349,There are a number of rebaselining that could be done to generate the funds but there is no clear idea of where it could come from without severely impacting other areas. It would be interesting to see where the money went when the funds were taken out of paying for university places - it wasn’t education. ,y
Depth5_464,Depth4_353,if the government was to cut all university fee's we would see a rise in drop outs and students who do not wish to study. Students who do not have to pay would be lazy and unaccomplished in their studies ,
Depth5_465,Depth4_353,Higher education should not just be available to the priviledged few - it should be available for all regardless of financial background.,y
Depth5_466,Depth4_353,Everyone should have the right to higher education. Educatikn needs to be free so that everyone has access to it.,y
Depth5_467,Depth4_353,"Every society needs individuals that have been educated to a high level and to help social mobility, an individual's socioeconomic background should not affect their ability to be educated to the highest level if they show talent. The government needs to invest in young people and higher education.",
Depth5_468,Depth4_353,"But further education could be for everyone. It dies not have to be an academic education, everyone should have the chance for a further education in a field that is suitable for them.",
Depth5_469,Depth4_368,How is the economy suppose to thrive when we are expected to pay 9k for education that benefits the future?,
Depth5_470,Depth4_368,But most priviledged students do get it for free from Daddy's pocket! Far from people 'respecting ' having to pay I believe it puts off many budding scholars due to costs. ,y
Depth5_471,Depth4_368,Not everone has the money to pay for it. If they have to take out loans they are then putting themselves it debt for years to come and thus decreasing their earnings that they went to university to increase in the first place.,y
Depth5_472,Depth4_368,Saddling young people with a 50 thousand pound debt before they even start their adult lives in employment is totally unfair. At the moment people with intellect and talent that could do society a great service are being put off from going to university.,
Depth5_473,Depth4_368,"So are you saying then that 'll education should be paid for from the beginning? Using that argument, you are saying that people will not value the education they are receiving from age 5.",
Depth5_474,Depth4_380,saving the economy should be greatly helped via the government and not lining the pockets of the rich to make them richer and the poor poorer,
Depth5_475,Depth4_380,There are not enough high paid jobs out there. Graduating does not guarantee getting a higher paid job and students could be stuck in debt for the rest of their lives.,
Depth5_476,Depth4_380,If the aim of going to university was to increase earnings paying a large amount of that back from their wage packet seems counter intuitive from the main aim of a higher paid career,
Depth5_477,Depth4_380,"They are enormous pressures on young people these days. For example, the lack of housing and high house prices and rents. Childcare costs too are prohibitive. Why burden them with enormous debt as well.",
Depth5_478,Depth4_380,"That is not always true. Although there is a correlation between further education and higher wages, this is not a guaranteed return on an investment and there for is not applicable here.",
Depth5_479,Depth4_389,"being in debt your whole life is a daunting thing, nobody wants to take a job where they have to lose pay due to previous studying to get that job in the first place. ",
Depth5_480,Depth4_389,The loans are hideous and can cause stress for many years. Getting a job alongside studying will be a drop in the ocean.,
Depth5_481,Depth4_389,"But the more you earn the higher the amount you pay back. With the amount of people currently going to higher education the market is currentlysaturated with qualified people all going for the same positions, thus not everyone can hold the higher positions.",y

Depth5_483,Depth4_389,"Your future master will not have a choice but to pay off their debt. To earn enough to invest in their future, they must also have to pay back the loan, delaying their savings.",
Depth5_484,Depth4_403,society would be a better place if everyone had access to the same FREE education ,
Depth5_485,Depth4_403,"But taxes pay for many things some which we use others which we don't you can't differentiate. We pay tax for the royals and we will never gain from that - but thats the way it goes,",
Depth5_486,Depth4_403,But if you make the education free the people who get the grades but are put off by the price may decide to go to university and persue the degrees that may increase their chance of getting into a trained career instead of a lower paid job. ,
Depth5_487,Depth4_403,As said previously we all benefit from the services provided by educated people. The contribution provided by individuals would need to be in proportion to their means. So higher earners would contribute more to the education system.,
Depth5_488,Depth4_403,A large proportion of people will never need to use the NHS or police to the level they have paid in taxed for them but are still happy to pay as it's benefits society as well as the individual.,
Depth5_489,Depth4_412,"you would not be able to live, should you study full time, work full time but get all your money taken back in tax for something that helped get them where they are today ",
Depth5_490,Depth4_412,Loans still rack up significant interest and is still stressful to have even if you do not earn enough to pay them off. They are constantly there.,
Depth5_491,Depth4_412,"However if education was free you would not have the burden hanging over you, if you earn just over the threshold you are still paying the same amount as some one who earns way over the threshold and therefore come off worse than someone who gets paid more yet both paid the same amount in fees and in loans.",
Depth5_492,Depth4_412,I think if people really understood the financial ramifications there would be significantly less people from poorer backgrounds going to university.,
Depth5_493,Depth4_412,I think perception needs to change as mist young people believe university is the only real way of increasing their earning potential and so will go regardless of the loans.,
Depth5_494,Depth4_357,Nan,

Depth5_501,Depth4_369,It can be difficult for people to obtain the necessary financial support. People do not like having to rely on benefits and funding university feed should be a right.,
Depth5_502,Depth4_369,Everyone must work hard for a degree. It's whether it's reasonable to expect students to work to earn money as well,
Depth5_503,Depth4_369,"True, but some people are disadvantaged solely based on a postcode lottery. For example, London vs Huddlesfield ; the latter has fewer multinational companies investing in the education sector in this area, thus there are fewer opportunities available to the locals there.",
Depth5_504,Depth4_382,That 9% is what some people might have left to live on,
Depth5_505,Depth4_382,No one ever pays back the full fee so what it the purpose of them being so high?,
Depth5_506,Depth4_382,People are scared of debt and of having to pay it back. Earning more money with more responsibility will not come with an appropriate increase in salary as more will need to be repayed on debt.,y
Depth5_507,Depth4_382,"At the age of 18, people may not be able to consider clearly that they may still have a loan to pay off 30 years later",
Depth5_508,Depth4_382,"However, unknown to many, interest is applied on top of student loans. It should be more explicit that this applies as it means students are paying for more than the true value of their education.",
Depth5_509,Depth4_390,How is it fair to penalize someone trying to better themselves,
Depth5_510,Depth4_390,"Again,few people ever pay their debt off so adding interest is pointless",
Depth5_511,Depth4_390,But the numbers involved can be hugh and too much debt to lumber people with. If start with a poorly paid job the debt becomes larger and larger.,y
Depth5_512,Depth4_390,"Compound interest can really rack up over years of being in a low paid work, making moving on more daunting",

Depth5_515,Depth4_404,"Not everyone needs to access university, many people go for the experience rather than to gain a useful qualification leading to a career. Certain degrees that benefit the tax payer should be subsidised whereas hobby based degrees should be paid for by the student",
Depth5_516,Depth4_404,Everyone pays taxes and those with university education often have better paid job so pay more back in taxes as it is.,
Depth5_517,Depth4_404,Everybody with the ability and desire to go to university should be able to and that benefits even those who do not go,
Depth5_518,Depth4_404,"Some cities are more expensive to live in than others, despite offering a similar level of education. Hence, access to university depends more on location than tax paying by this logic.",
Depth5_519,Depth4_416,It might be small but that might be what a person had to live on till next pay day,
Depth5_520,Depth4_416,"Not everyone does a degree with a specific job in mind. It is down to the individual to plan ahead and consider their career options carefully. The loan percentage is deducted based on salary. The higher the pay, the higher the deduction. ",
Depth5_521,Depth4_416,There is mental pressure if someone can not find a job soon after leaving university with a mounting debt. It may be a small amount of money taken but at a time when people need money to set up in life.,
Depth5_522,Depth4_416,9% of your income is not small and over decades equals for more than the original cost,
Depth5_523,Depth4_416,"The current system, without the help of loans, provides an non-intellect based advantage to the more wealthy. Hence, the argument of being put in a better position only applies to the more well-off primarily.",
Depth5_524,Depth4_364,Yes it should be less or free,
Depth5_525,Depth4_364,NAN,
Depth5_526,Depth4_364,A lot of people can not afford to go to university due to the high fees and reduced maintenance loans and the end of maintenance grants. This can lead to inequality within society and a reduced talent pool in society. ,
Depth5_527,Depth4_364,"Free education shouldn't be limited to the most talented people, everyone should have the opportunity of higher education no matter their background",
Depth5_528,Depth4_364,Nan,
Depth5_529,Depth4_375,I agree with it is only a temporary measure,
Depth5_530,Depth4_375,"Yes, but in the meantime they need to live and maybe even provide for a family, there should be grants available or they should be paid a decent wage.",
Depth5_531,Depth4_375,However for people to get this experience they need the salary in order to afford transport and living costs to their apprenticeships. Without this they cannot gain this fundamental experience. It also creates inequality in the workplace as other members of staff could be earning triple what you earn. This can demotivate those on the apprenticeship pay and made them feel unvalued.,
Depth5_532,Depth4_375,"That's if they get a job from it. They pay less than the cost of living, if they weren't to get a job at the end of it they'll struggle to pay to live and definitely won't have any savings to support themselves until they do get a job.",
Depth5_533,Depth4_375,But it could take 3 years to train by which time the individual may have large debt. Further there may not be any jobs within their field when trained. ,
Depth5_534,Depth4_386,The quicker any debt is paid off the better for all concerned,
Depth5_535,Depth4_386,"Even with higher repayments, the loan is constantly gathering interest and the payments will take a whilst to start paying off the actual loan",
Depth5_536,Depth4_386,Having a 50k student debt is a huge deterrent for those applying for university. Interest on the loans are a lot higher so the loan will just increase further.,
Depth5_537,Depth4_386,"I agree with the loan seeming more insignificant, if they have a high salary, but that will only be a very small percentage of people. It won't happen as soon as someone has graduated ",
Depth5_538,Depth4_386,The loan my provide a better future therefore there should be no rush to pay it back. If the cost out weighs the wage increase it would not be worth the loan. ,
Depth5_539,Depth4_393,We are taxed on practically everything and the government wastes so much of that,
Depth5_540,Depth4_393,Graduates benefit society in that they go into work and start contributing to tax and so the cycle begins again. It's continuously beneficial. ,
Depth5_541,Depth4_393,"However, fees should have never been raised to 9k per year, those in wales pay 3k per year and Scottish residents don’t pay for university. So why should English students have to pay the huge difference.",
Depth5_542,Depth4_393,So why not tax people once they have graduated and landed a well paid job within the industry their degree is related too,
Depth5_543,Depth4_393,"10 years ago education at university level was free and students were given grants not loans. So why should it be different now, the government provided funding then, so why should it be different for this generation.",
Depth5_544,Depth4_405,Loans put a burden on the whole family not just that person with the loan,
Depth5_545,Depth4_405,"But a high number of students go to university with the intention of gaining full time employment or even becoming self employed, not everyone wants to be a doctor, but the world needs everything from event managers to librarians, all of which have dedicated university courses. ",
Depth5_546,Depth4_405,We need increased skills in our society to better our country and life. Such professions like teaching and being a nurse have rather poor salaries in comparison to the demand of their service in society. ,
Depth5_547,Depth4_405,The rest of society won't mind paying a bit more tax if it means there's most well trained doctors and teachers.,
Depth5_548,Depth4_405,But it may give an individual skills that they wouldn’t have got if not attended university. People do not have to be doctors etc to have benefited from university. ,
Depth5_549,Depth4_417,Everyone should be given a choice without worrying if they going to get into financial hardship along the way,
Depth5_550,Depth4_417,"If everyone paid it would cost less overall and as soon as someone goes into full time work, they know they are helping others achieve their dreams. ",
Depth5_551,Depth4_417,Today’s generations are poorer than those of their parents in order to benefit society universities should at least have lower fees into order to attract more students and educate more of the population.,

Depth5_553,Depth4_417,It isn’t fair that for three years while at university students live on little money. Then once they get a job money is taken out of their wages. It isn’t about who wants to study it is more about who can afford to study - discriminating against people who can’t afford to. ,

Depth5_569,Depth4_462,There is still a burden on middle to low income earners who have to pay back the loan and it significantly affects their future purchasing power. We must take these people into account (there are many of them).,

Depth5_583,Depth4_484,"Free education would give everyone a fair opportunity to get a high paid, well-skilled job in an area they have a desire to succeed in. The way it currently is reduces lots of people’s chances to go and try their best in the field that they would love to get a job in.",
Depth5_584,Depth4_426,"People can only achieve what they are able to achieve, a degree is not a ticket to a job. It doesn’t help that interest is still applied during periods of unemployment such as maternity leave or leave for childcare.",
Depth5_585,Depth4_426,There is more pressure because it is important to reduce the debt you obtain through student loans ,
Depth5_586,Depth4_426,it is easier to get a job and slowly pay off te loan,y
Depth5_587,Depth4_426,The interest rates are extortionate with students losing out by simply paying back the interest when they earn enough.,
Depth5_588,Depth4_426,With the large amount borrowed the interest accumulates very quickly and tends to cause the loan to increase,
Depth5_589,Depth4_434,"A degree isn’t a golden ticket, unless you want to be a doctor or something that requires that kind of education. The loan payments are taken from your wages before tax and are proportional to your wages over £15k. In your working life there will be time to pay this off.",
Depth5_590,Depth4_434,So not being able to afford the fee's put those at a disadvantage in finding a job,
Depth5_591,Depth4_434,you can build up your own credit rate,
Depth5_592,Depth4_434,More often than not we see people getting better jobs through other routes but having no fees would definitely promote university culture.,
Depth5_593,Depth4_434,Degrees are not worth what they used to be. Many graduates wind up in low paying jobs unrelated to their job regardless.,
Depth5_594,Depth4_446,The public would not agree to increasing tax or sacrificing other things to increase the amount of money available to provide free education. This way works best but it is not perfect. There are areas such as the vulnerable and the NHS that need money more.,
Depth5_595,Depth4_446,"Student loans barely cover the cost of student accommodation, never mind the cost of living or any disposable income ",
Depth5_596,Depth4_446,i dont think the loan programs make it easier for students,
Depth5_597,Depth4_446,Maybe utilising a better tax system would give us the opportunity to remove university fees.,
Depth5_598,Depth4_446,Maintenance Grant's aren't available anymore. Most students have to get jobs unless they have help from family. Free education would allow students to solely focus on their studies.,
Depth5_599,Depth4_465,No one can predict the future and people will always want to achieve the best they can and this is not always possible. Everything is a risk however they have been given the best possible opportunity.,
Depth5_600,Depth4_465,Therefore there is increased pressure to get a decent job straight after graduation,
Depth5_601,Depth4_465,it is a learning call,
Depth5_602,Depth4_465,"Completely agree, university is not and should not be used as a route to a ‘possibly’ better career, realistically it means nothing now.",
Depth5_603,Depth4_465,Many people can't. Often people wind up getting lower paying jobs unrelated to their degree and the 'grace period' just causes interest to accumulate ,
Depth5_604,Depth4_471,People have to make sacrifices of further education isn’t viable for them then there are options such as the Open University that can be done part time.,
Depth5_605,Depth4_471,It is not fair for a person who has added responsibilities of caring for others to be at a disadvantage and have to pay for something that can be afforded easily by others,
Depth5_606,Depth4_471,it is wrong to make people to take out loans just to get through university,
Depth5_607,Depth4_471,Just because you get a loan does not mean it covers the remaining cost of living and covering your family.,
Depth5_608,Depth4_471,People often dont fully repay the loan anyway. Wouldn't it be easier to abolish fees to make it fair for all people?,
Depth5_609,Depth4_486,There will always be people who will be unhappy it is impossible to find something that works for everybody.,
Depth5_610,Depth4_486,"The same argument could be used for schools - why is that free and University isn't? School is wasted on some people who do not show up/ do not try in exams, yet that is still free",
Depth5_611,Depth4_486,i feel every one should be entitled to education,
Depth5_612,Depth4_486,"Quality will not lower, it is probably more likely to increase with more students and hence more competition.",
Depth5_613,Depth4_486,That's not necessarily true. Gaining a degree takes a lot of time and effort. People unlikely to put in the effort are unlikely to go through it if it's free. Making it free would allow people who see cost as a barrier to gain an education ,
Depth5_614,Depth4_427,Graduates should not be forced to immediately choose a career because they may end up in a job that they do not enjoy or a role with minimal opportunities for advancement. ,
Depth5_615,Depth4_427,The interest rate is high and even paying off a monthly amount from a highly paid job is paying off the interest and not the actual loan itself,
Depth5_616,Depth4_427,But where is the support in finding a job? The fees are too expensive.,
Depth5_617,Depth4_427,"highly paid jobs aren't falling from trees, so a lot of graduates end up taking jobs that won't enough with cost living to pay the loans back.",
Depth5_618,Depth4_427,It causes unnecessary stress to rush and settle down in a high paid career rather than exploring options. A race to earn money rather than pursue and enjoy your job choice. ,
Depth5_619,Depth4_436,Some people are forced into debt due to circumstances beyond their control and a degree has consistently been proven to be a factor that influences lifetime earnings. ,
Depth5_620,Depth4_436,"People usually don't have an opportunity to build credit whilst in school, so basing a student loan on a credit score seems ridiculous",
Depth5_621,Depth4_436,Life isn't cheap you know. People should be given chances.,
Depth5_622,Depth4_436,The cost of living is to high to circumnavigate the loan and the interest on it.,
Depth5_623,Depth4_436,Why create a generation with debt when their career choices are helping the future?,
Depth5_624,Depth4_447,Surely your argument is also a case for the German system? The wider economy should shoulder the burden for higher education because it adds more value to thee system in the long run.,
Depth5_625,Depth4_447,Many students work along side their studies and contribute to the tax system.,
Depth5_626,Depth4_447,Not true. Why can't we follow the rest of Europe? We should treat our young people better..,
Depth5_627,Depth4_447,Which is even more of a reason to remove university fees. We have high taxes here as swell as a high cost of living.,
Depth5_628,Depth4_447,Everybody can easy access the free education allowing more people the opportunity to pursue higher paid careers allowing more people to pay larger amounts of tax. ,
Depth5_629,Depth4_466,Often those higher paying jobs are de facto reserved for students of only the most elite universities. This means that many students who attend less prestigious institutions still end up in low paying jobs.,
Depth5_630,Depth4_466,NAN,
Depth5_631,Depth4_466,Or perhaps scrap university fees totally.,
Depth5_632,Depth4_466,Many Europeans countries have lower taxes which helps and cost of living lower.,
Depth5_633,Depth4_466,"I believe that charging for education is elitist, allowing rich people access to the best education only ensures that wealth is concentrated within their families and allowing them to hoard more wealth in the future. ",
Depth5_634,Depth4_476,"Whilst it may be theoretically possible to send a student to a higher education institution, it is important that this is done in a way that is not detrimental to a person's standard of living. ",
Depth5_635,Depth4_476,"For families relying on the individual to be the main provider, going to university is not the most stable choice, however knowing they do not have the burden of debt to worry about would increase their opportunities to go to university and focus on the work, as well as maybe having a job along side.",
Depth5_636,Depth4_476,But higher education opens doors. We are pressured in society to have degrees to succeed. And at a cost.,
Depth5_637,Depth4_476,There is no job that pays well enough for a person to study and be the main provider.,
Depth5_638,Depth4_476,Student loans only keep people shackled with lifelong debt slavery. Being unable to build personal wealth and invest in a pension ensures that they will be working long into their life and unable to enjoy the production of their career. ,
Depth5_639,Depth4_491,Abolishing university fees would negate the need to treat them differently in the first place. The ability to access higher education should not depend on personal wealth.,
Depth5_640,Depth4_491,"Just because an individual has wealthy parents, does not mean they are wealthy, By looking at a family's circumstance it does not reflect the student's circumstance. ",
Depth5_641,Depth4_491,No it is not. Everyone struggles and should be treated fairly.,
Depth5_642,Depth4_491,"That is known as elitism, where the well off have access to higher education thus giving them a better paying job.",
Depth5_643,Depth4_491,"Every person should be treated as an individual and not as part of a legacy, or discriminated against because of their back ground (whether that be from wealth or poverty). If university is paid from taxes based on income, it ensure that anyone that has prospered from the country pays back into the country subject to their income. ",
Depth5_644,Depth4_492,The thought that possibly in the future the fees will still need to be paid off will put off a lot of students who may not have savings to fund them.,
Depth5_645,Depth4_492,"Why should only better off people have a chance at higher education? Everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their wealth",
Depth5_646,Depth4_492,It will still make them feel like they are being judged and it may put some students off of apply for university in the first place,
Depth5_647,Depth4_492,If I took out a mortgage I would expect to be means tested and repay the loan that I had taken out,
Depth5_648,Depth4_492,"Fees should be abolished, if you take in to account the quality of life in sweden where taxes, education and fees are all absolutely less than they are in the UK and they are so much happier it only makes sense we follow suit. Also it is very hard to pay the student loans back putting people off earning over a certain amount.",
Depth5_649,Depth4_504,The investment in providing a good education for people and being able to fulfil gaps in our workforce without relying on other workforces outside our own country would out way a large majority of the cost of funding courses.,y
Depth5_650,Depth4_504,People who get a job straight after leaving school would be better off than people who have spent 3 years working really hard to obtain further knowledge and qualifications,
Depth5_651,Depth4_504,If student fees were abolished then there would be no need for loans so it would take away this pressure on young people,
Depth5_652,Depth4_504,"Not everyone gets access to higher education, so you should pay back the loan",
Depth5_653,Depth4_504,"I agree, students do end up paying back loans their entire lives, this puts people off going to uni in the first place or getting a well paid job once they have finished. If fee's were abolished everyone would be able to attend university without fear ",
Depth5_654,Depth4_517,The level of stress put upon students to work and study is pushing some students to the edge and is therefore having an adverse effect on their mental health and ability to learn.,
Depth5_655,Depth4_517,Why should young people be in debt for most of their life simply for choosing to improve themselves? They are contributing to society as a whole by bringing skills and knowledge gained at university ,
Depth5_656,Depth4_517,They will then be forced to put off their education for a year and they may not bother going to university which means they might miss out on job opportunities later in life,
Depth5_657,Depth4_517,You don’t start paying back until after you get a better paying role,
Depth5_658,Depth4_517,"with the cost of living these days, one years salary will not even make a dent in a student loan",
Depth5_659,Depth4_526,Quality education should be available to all and the opportunity to introduce this type of education into families who have never used this facility should be encouraged for future generations.,
Depth5_660,Depth4_526,Why should only bright students benefit from scholarships? There are also students who may not be deemed ‘the brightest in the class’ but they are eager and willing to learn,

Depth5_662,Depth4_526,Not everything is available to everyone eg mortgages etc ,

Depth5_669,Depth4_544,The worry of outstanding debt and its effect on future financial plans and any changes to the repayment system introduced by future governments could deter many students from applying for an appropriate course .,
Depth5_670,Depth4_544,I still disagree with the repayments! The skills and knowledge these graduated would bring to the economy is far more valuable than the money they’re slowly paying back for many years of their adult life,
Depth5_671,Depth4_544,But the idea of being in a large amount of debt for a long time may put some people off of going to university ,
Depth5_672,Depth4_544,People have the burden of mortgages for the majority of their lives,
Depth5_673,Depth4_544,"there already is a system like that in place currently, we have seen over the years it does not work and peolpe still end up with debt forever",y
Depth5_674,Depth4_496,Everyone has debts no matter what. There should be a better support system in place to avoid that.,
Depth5_675,Depth4_496,"agreed its not beneficial for students to have debts but means testing students, can result in a further inequality divide and students from from high income backgrounds being seen as more likely to repay loans",
Depth5_676,Depth4_496,People shouldn’t be punished for earning more. ,
Depth5_677,Depth4_496,At the end of the day you need to be stable to afford education and any payback should be in assisted,
Depth5_678,Depth4_496,"If some students are paying less towards repaying their loans, then there will be a higher burden on other students and fees may rise to mitigate the difference. Fees should be lower in general so that everyone can afford them. Rather than having some paying more and some paying less.",
Depth5_679,Depth4_496,"Those who earn less should always have better help if they are to achieve similar heights, goals or ambitions to those who begin life supported or with financial safety nets. ",
Depth5_680,Depth4_505,It is still expensive. You get payments taken out of your wage each month and it just doesn't stop.,

Depth5_682,Depth4_505,"Rubbish, the interest rate is something ridiculous like 9% and I bet the interest is added daily meaning the actual interest rate is a lot higher",
Depth5_683,Depth4_505,The interest for a education loan should be the same as any other one from bank clients even if they have to pay it back their whole life’s.,
Depth5_684,Depth4_505,"Student loans should not be equated to other bank loans. Education should be an option to everyone in the country and people should not be put off by high interest.

Depth5_685,Depth4_505,"It depends whether students are reaching the desired income to completely pay back their student loans. Some students will spend their entire life paying back student loan interest alone, which is unfair. ",

Depth5_688,Depth4_518,The interest rates are not lower and the government shouldn’t be punishing people who are seeking employment and skills and instead focus on other areas to save money ,
Depth5_689,Depth4_518,There needs to be the pressure as a lot of people go to school then give up after. The pressure is good for paying back,
Depth5_690,Depth4_518,"Although contact time is low, full-time education should be full-time. A lot of time at university should be spent completing work in your own time, e.g. revising for exams, completing assignments, conducting field work, etc. To complete a degree and also have a job reduces the value of the degree. What is the point of doing it in the first place if you are not going to commit to it 100%. It is better for your future employment prospects if you get a higher classification (i.e. first or 2:1), therefore you should give it your all. Also doing a degree and having a job can have a serious detrimenal effect on the mental health of these people.",y
Depth5_691,Depth4_518,"We're spending too much time focusing on universal ideas about who can and can't work around study, and not enough time thinking about how different students can be juggling other commitments which prevent the ability to work including disability and caring. ",
Depth5_692,Depth4_528,Why can't all universities do this? Then we would be in less of a predicament. ,
Depth5_693,Depth4_528,"the grants and loans are not necessarily enough to make ends meet especially in high cost of living areas, where parental support maybe needed ",
Depth5_694,Depth4_528,You could have rich parents so don’t get any maintenance loans but the parents might not give you any money ,
Depth5_695,Depth4_528,That it is unfair for the same education with two different prices,
Depth5_696,Depth4_528,"Even with the extra help, these bursaries often are not enough. The extra grants and loans are often not enough to even cover the cost of living/rent. Also there is a problem with the 'squeezed middle' - those students who are not considered 'poor enough' to receive extra help in the form of grants/bursaries but also do not receive additional support from family. Financial status is judged of the earnings of family/parents, however, this doesn't mean that a student will therefore receive financial support from their parents/family. The basic maintenance loan from the government doesn't even cover the rent for accommodation for most students, so fundamentally students either need a grant/additional loan or family support.",
Depth5_697,Depth4_528,"The grants and loans provided are not sufficient for many people to live on, especially if they face additional financial barriers or are entering university later in life. ",
Depth5_698,Depth4_538,"However, not all schools do this. Not many students are given support, especially in low income backgrounds.",
Depth5_699,Depth4_538,if degrees are what students are using to place themselves for future careers they should be fully aware of where their degree may take them. So they can make a fully informed choice on what field of study would best suit them,

Depth5_702,Depth4_538,"A university is essentially selling a degree as a product that will make you more employable in a particular area. Therefore, I do think it is the responsibility of a university to provide this informaiton and advice. It is not schools who are being paid the tuition fee of the degree.

Depth5_703,Depth4_538,"Students should be told about all career options throughout education, but also university should be accessible and affordable for people from all backgrounds. ",
Depth5_704,Depth4_545,"This does not matter. Just because you are an adult, does not mean you should be financial stable. No one is.",
Depth5_705,Depth4_545,so we want to encourage a society of burdens,
Depth5_706,Depth4_545,Not everyone has that sort of money to pay off a loan. It’s hard to know whether paying the loan off early is worth it when you are on a low salary,
Depth5_707,Depth4_545,They shouldn’t go into higher education if they don’t understand the money side. They need to afford the bill at the end of the day as they are given a service (education),
Depth5_708,Depth4_545,It is unfair for anyone to have a significant debt hanging over their head for a long time for completing an education that I believe everybody is entitled to. There are many reasons people might be in a financial situation that means they cannot pay the loan back,
Depth5_709,Depth4_545,"Young people are not told enough about interest rates, student debt or repayments before starting university, and education should not be an unreasonable cost or burden for anyone. ",
Depth5_710,Depth4_500,I don't think it is manageable at all. It basically hangs over your head forever whilst you struggle to pay taxes.,
Depth5_711,Depth4_500,You won’t have to pay back any unless you get a well paying job,
Depth5_712,Depth4_500,Affordable' is a very subjective term; some people will not find it affordable. The fact that loans can be written off after a certain amount of time may put people off seeking higher-paid employment.,

Depth5_714,Depth4_500,"University fees may discourage those who have no means of paying off the loans, abolishing fees would mean everyone has an equal opportunity ",
Depth5_715,Depth4_516,"However, it is not always easy to balance. Give them a break. The majority of careers require an advanced qualification, especially if someone wants to become a doctor.",
Depth5_716,Depth4_516,That excludes low income people from university and creates an unbalanced society ,
Depth5_717,Depth4_516,"These days it has become a standard requirement to have a University education, not an advantage. The job market is poor, and many young people feel pressured into going to University.",
Depth5_718,Depth4_516,Why should they have to balance education should be free full stop,
Depth5_719,Depth4_516,"Having a degree has the potential to put those who have one at an advantage, why should people be discouraged from having an education simply because they are unable to lean on parents or careers for financial support. ",
Depth5_720,Depth4_523,But the government are not stepping in for this surely? Too many people? That just sounds biased.,
Depth5_721,Depth4_523,There are currently insufficient scholarships to allow all those capable on low income to attend. ,
Depth5_722,Depth4_523,"Education will remain a privilege for children from wealthier backgrounds, and social inequality will be perpetuated by University fees.",
Depth5_723,Depth4_523,This is how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,
Depth5_724,Depth4_523,Everyone should be given equal opportunities. Why should ‘talented young people’ be given any more of an opportunity then those who aren’t considered ‘talented’. What about those who are ‘talented’ but have wealthy parents? Would they have to pay fees? How is that fair? Abolishing the fees means everyone is given the same opportunity no matter the background they have came from. ,
Depth5_725,Depth4_533,I know that life isn't free but education should be. We should all be passionate but not at a cost.,
Depth5_726,Depth4_533,Most students get it “for free” as in their parents pay. There is no evidence to suggest lower income students are any less grateful. ,
Depth5_727,Depth4_533,"People are not usually paying from their own pocket - they rely on loans, and resign themselves to a lifetime of repaying them. I do not feel that students valuer their education more when they charged for it.",
Depth5_728,Depth4_533,Shouldn't the student be at least given a chance to prove themselves everyone develops differently and they might just be a late bloomer,
Depth5_729,Depth4_533,Surely university’s would still be able to accept those who work hard and get the grades? As they do now. Students who do not work hard would not be able to study for their degree. ,
Depth5_730,Depth4_540,Yes the loan does count against your credit score. And who said it would be written off? That is not correct.,
Depth5_731,Depth4_540,It’s takes a very long time to be written off and still has a massive psychological impact,
Depth5_732,Depth4_540,"For talented young people from poorer backgrounds, the prospect of repaying their loan for many years may be the decision-maker that University is not for them, as they need money now.",
Depth5_733,Depth4_540,Any debt would stop someone getting on with there lives,
Depth5_734,Depth4_540,"Although the loan doesn't count against their credit score and will be written off, the pressure to pay it off will still be there. Students will not be able to save up and pay for nice things like holidays, as any extra money they do have will be needed to pay off the loan. ",
Depth5_735,Depth4_550,"There is a competition, no need to deny it. Each person is worthy, we are all worthy.",
Depth5_736,Depth4_550,"Then all university places should be based on merit alone, not funding. And scrapping fees addresses this.",
Depth5_737,Depth4_550,"We will still end up with a disproportionate representation of wealthier students versus those from poorer backgrounds, who may not be any better than the 'good' students who didn't meet the competitive requirements for a scholarship.",
Depth5_738,Depth4_550,This is why it should be free for all,
Depth5_739,Depth4_550,Everyone should be given equal opportunity. Who draws the line and those who are extraordinary and who is not. Why should certain students be given better opportunities and other aren’t? ,
Depth5_740,Depth4_553,"Not all academic people are from well off backgrounds, the loan won't pay for day to day living whilst studying, they shouldn't have to take on casual work if they're wanting to put everything into their degree",

Depth5_743,Depth4_553,"The breaks are not meant to be spent stacking shelves or delivering pizzas, they are meant for consolidation of knowledge and expanding horizons.",
Depth5_744,Depth4_553,Working and studying at the same time can be very stressful ,
Depth5_745,Depth4_553,"University fees stop students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from continuing their education, low socioeconomic status does not mean lower academic ability. There are intelligent people who have been unable to further their studies due to lack on money, those people could, if given the chance, become good teachers, doctors, surgeons, professors. You cannot gauge someones future potential by their economic status.",
Depth5_746,Depth4_553,Some students may not be able to look for work due to other commitments and having the additional pressure of knowing you have a loan or needing to find additional work to supplement costs could cause additional strain and impact on the students performance whereby if fees were non existent this would not be an issue ,
Depth5_747,Depth4_562,It would give more freedom for people from a range of backgrounds to study and help with career progression giving them better job opportunities and knowledge,
Depth5_748,Depth4_562,But by abolishing these fee’s we are giving people from a mix of backgrounds an equal chance regardless.,
Depth5_749,Depth4_562,If that certain person works hard over and over again they’ll be able to get the money together and get what they want,
Depth5_750,Depth4_562,"The people with degrees who do not earn decent money, indulged in the study of useless subjects with no or very little commercial value. What a waste of time and effort that is a waste of tax payer resources.",
Depth5_751,Depth4_562,Nan,
Depth5_752,Depth4_562,"There is a lot of nepotism. People often gets jobs because of who they know rather than what they are able to do. Being exposed to a rich learning environment, not just in an academic setting, gives people a thirst to learn and grow. People often over-estimate their own ability, they have less skills and flexible thinking. People from all backgrounds should be able to access further education not just those who can afford additional tutoring and private schooling.",
Depth5_753,Depth4_562,Statistically it is proven that those with degrees earn more money over their lifetime than those without degrees so it is fair to say that it broadens horizons and opportunities,

Depth5_756,Depth4_572,Everyone should be able to enter it for education. Even if that person had a poor background maybe they can change it by going,
Depth5_757,Depth4_572,"Those who have the opportunity to benefit from the best education available should be expected to contribute more to the society that enabled it. It is clear that so many professional move into private practice or early retirement at the earliest opportunity thus short-changing the people who gave them the opportunity, so it only fair that they should be expected to pay a graduate tax that is means tested and progressive in nature. They do not pay it back if they do not earn enough, and it is written off after 30 years so it is not a true debt.",
Depth5_758,Depth4_572,Everyone should have a equal opportunity to learn and get a education regards of earnings,
Depth5_759,Depth4_572,"There should be alternative routes such as apprenticeships and vocational training. This trio-path system of vocational training, apprenticeships and higher education would allow those less academic to progress their career paths, while reducing the number of further education places. Further education is not necessary for all but should be debt free for those who choose this path. A country needs a wide range of workers to function. Not everyone needs to go to university but this who do will pay back in taxes what it cost for them to study when they are in work and over their life career. ",
Depth5_760,Depth4_572,"Abolishing fees is also investing in the future economy with people who can learn invaluable skills and add to the job market, we have a skills shortage in this country and if more people went to university without dear of debt we wouldn't need to search overseas as much for certain skills ",
Depth5_761,Depth4_582,"Loans always cause debt. Loan companies would be out of business if they just gave money away, the interest rates they apply and expect people to default is what brings in profit for them",

Depth5_764,Depth4_582,"Stop moaning about debt. It is not included in mortgage affordability, it does not affect your credit rating, you do not pay anything back unless you are earning a decent amount.

If everyone had a degree, who would empty the bins but those who are enabled to study to gain a degree shouldn't only be those who are well enough off to afford further education before continuing their further education. Many middle income families are struggling to make ends meet, many lower income families don't recognise further education as a possibility.

It would be the teacher who decided who got to know about the scholarship, those students who weren't seen as able/worthy would miss out. The scholarship system would bot be any less discriminatory than it is right now, still the well off and selected few would get to access the further education system not those with the most potential.

Depth5_1007,Depth4_681,"Occasionally people may have to borrow whilst struggling to find employment so even if they do ""save money"" before they graduate they still generally end up in a deficit and poor. ",
Depth5_1008,Depth4_681,"However, this is a massive drain on government funds - as most people will never pay these fees back in full making them pay is a complete fallacy and essentially just an additional tax on the wealthy few repaying student debt",
Depth5_1009,Depth4_691,"But we have seen rent rising in most areas, with no rise int eh loan amount meaning many students have to rely on the bank of mum or dad or cannot not afford to probable afford university",
Depth5_1010,Depth4_691,"The fees should not be necessary, the Government should fund education for people, especially the lower class. They will have run up far more debt that just a student loan and will find it very difficult to pay it back.",
Depth5_1011,Depth4_691,Grants arent as accessible as they used to be and it isn't fair that people from lower economic groups should have more debt,
Depth5_1012,Depth4_691,"University is not accessible to all. Many of the bursaries you describe are dependent on your parent's income, so that even if they're in debt, poor and you don't live with them; you still may be declined on the basis that they're expected to pay for you. In most poor families, parents can't actually afford to subsidise their children like this. ",
Depth5_1013,Depth4_691,"The government mustn't pass the buck of looking after those from less privileged backgrounds to universities - it is the government's responsibility to ensure equal access to education, not just providers'",
Depth5_1014,Depth4_702,"the amount of 9k can be seem unfair to some courses which have less contact hours and money uni need to spend on them, so end up funding more reosurce heavy subjects such as biology and chemistry.",
Depth5_1015,Depth4_702,"It is not a students choice to be poor in the first place, they should receive all the help they can get including a good education. Loans should not be a part of the choice of whether they should get further education to better themselves.",
Depth5_1016,Depth4_702,Schools push students to go to university and it is mandatory for many entry level careers now,
Depth5_1017,Depth4_702,"Students are absolutely compelled as expectations from employers are steadily becoming more and more ridiculous and many ask for a degree even for very easy roles. So, students who couldn't afford uni, but are perfectly capable of the job, will be unfairly automatically screened out. ",
Depth5_1018,Depth4_702,So you are saying that those who can't afford £9k just shouldn't go to university? That is entirely exclusionary and elitist.,
Depth5_1019,Depth4_717,the threshold never rises although living costs are constantly rising. so becomes unfair,
Depth5_1020,Depth4_717,"Yes, but if the person is lucky enough to get a good job they will still not find it easy to repay a loan as they will have many other financial commitments. This will add stress and worry to their lives.",
Depth5_1021,Depth4_717,And if they reach the threshold they will be paying for many years so that can be offputting ,y
Depth5_1022,Depth4_717,A person cannot be expected to never reach this threshold and once they do even tiny amounts of debt can cause a lot of stress if ongoing for a large period of time. Especially where fully repaying it may seem an impossible task. ,
Depth5_1023,Depth4_717,"But this reverts the debt to the public purse and the taxpayer, such that government isn't just covering costs for universities, it's also paying a high markup from the universities which it likely wouldn't be charged if it had an agreement to fund all HE courses",
Depth5_1024,Depth4_727,"That could be argued as unfair as its not the person who got the best out of uni and a better job, having to pay it back but someone who failed or found a less well paid job gets off cost free.",
Depth5_1025,Depth4_727,"It is unfair to expect students to live with the worry of having to repay a loan, they might even be forced to turn down a good job because it will take them into the higher pay threshold. ",
Depth5_1026,Depth4_727,It makes sense to incentivise careers that are most needed in society regardless of their pay,
Depth5_1027,Depth4_727,It's not fair to say they may never have to pay for it as they are very much expected to and this expectation will loom over any decisions made. ,
Depth5_1028,Depth4_727,"But it's about fear of debt, whether or not it's likely to be paid back can keep people awake at night - debt is a terrifying concept for many",
Depth5_1029,Depth4_736,"However, university also provides more than just a course, with social aspects and fiscal responsibility/independence, which allows people to grow are quicker and to give them time to find their right career path for them",
Depth5_1030,Depth4_736,You cannot presume that more people would opt for education just because it's free. And to say they would not take the course seriously is an insult. I would think it more likely that richer students will not take it seriously as they have nothing to lose and will likely be handed a job on a plate due to family connections.,
Depth5_1031,Depth4_736,Scrapping fees would make many universities more selective in who they accept. Students still need to demonstrate sufficient intelligence to get in,
Depth5_1032,Depth4_736,Academic success isn't the only factor of university being an important experience. The students will also learn lots of social and life skills so that even if they aren't academically skilled they can still benefit from the experience hugely. ,
Depth5_1033,Depth4_736,"By that logic, should schools be free? Obviously not. Upskilling the population and providing fair and equitable access to higher education should be considered as important to the progression of society as free education in schools ",
Depth5_1034,Depth4_740,"The repayments may not appeal vast individually but when you look at the total amount repaid per person, we are talking about large amounts of money.",
Depth5_1035,Depth4_740,Having to take out any type of loan means there are still hidden costs in going to uni,
Depth5_1036,Depth4_740,"as they will be spending more of their disposal income in the economy it will grow meaning greater prosperity for all. Increasing income from vat, corporation and income tax revenues to government making it more affordable for the government to provide free university places for all",
Depth5_1037,Depth4_740,I don't believe that paying all the money to get further education is worth it. There is no guarantee that you will get a job straight away after leaving university,
Depth5_1038,Depth4_740,There is no guarantee people will earn enough after gaining their degree and therefore their debt will remain with gaining interest for many years more. I don't think it is fair to saddle people with this debt.,

Depth5_1043,Depth4_749,"No matter how motivated some people are, if they are from underprivileged backgrounds they may not believe that they will ever achieve their dreams and the fees should not be a barrier to talented people's dreams. ",
Depth5_1044,Depth4_764,If there is no way to determine what jobs contribute to society then why not scrap all course fees? Doing this would undeniably benefit society.,
Depth5_1045,Depth4_764,nothing would have to be morally selected at all. my arguement is that all fees for all courses should be scrapped,y
Depth5_1046,Depth4_764,surely it is best to attract the best possible candidates to such roles who will by the very nature of the job they eventually perform will contribute greatly to society,
Depth5_1047,Depth4_764,"Yes you're correct, but tell me... what jobs, other than the ones that I have said, contribute the same amount or more than the ones that I have said",
Depth5_1048,Depth4_764,"Service jobs such as teaching and nursing are always low paying and undervalued, therefore it is important that these jobs are excluded from fees in order to retain a large service workforce.",
Depth5_1049,Depth4_773,How easy or hard a career is to get into should not affect how much a course costs.,
Depth5_1050,Depth4_773,it shouldn't matter how hard it is to find a job after in some areas. the idea is that we would like to live and a society that is better educated on a whole,
Depth5_1051,Depth4_773,burdening students with debt worries whilst they are studying adds to the pressures that they face and can lead to increased drop out rates.,
Depth5_1052,Depth4_773,But there is always a way into some where. Whether it is connections within the work company or by working hard,
Depth5_1053,Depth4_773,If some careers are harder to get into then more people should be given a chance to train for those jobs and not be excluded because of fees.,
Depth5_1054,Depth4_793,"Actually more and more young people are already choosing apprenticeships etc over university. Also, there is no disadvantage to having a degree, other than the debt.",
Depth5_1055,Depth4_793,It is a question of opportunity. that should be the arguement at hand. to give people more choice regardless of their expectation or choices they would have to make about choosing higher education or not,y
Depth5_1056,Depth4_793,for certain professions and roles apprenticeships are the best way forward and it is only equitable for all students who are continuing in education to be treated the same no matter which course and route of study they pursue ,
Depth5_1057,Depth4_793,I very much doubt that because they will be more inclined to learn something and take the challenge because they aren't paying for anything.,
Depth5_1058,Depth4_793,"That will always be the case even if there are fees to pay for, as some students think that degrees are going to help them but then find the course is not to their liking. I don't think we can blame people for trying as it shows aspiration.",
Depth5_1059,Depth4_799,"just because the debt isn't crippling doesn't mean it's ok. If I rob a bank and only steal a ""tiny fraction"" of their money, I'm still going to prison.",
Depth5_1060,Depth4_799,"They would like to educate themselves free of debt, there is no telling what the job market will be like for them after, no matter the the level of education",
Depth5_1061,Depth4_799,for some the most worthwhile jobs for instance in social sector they are never likely to earn the minimum income threshold so whats the point of burdening them with debts that will never be repaid,
Depth5_1062,Depth4_799,"It may be a tiny fraction, but you are still in debt. So you still have to pay off the debt",
Depth5_1063,Depth4_799,The debt is not a tiny fraction if you are in a service job such as nursing and have to pay for rent and living expenses. People should not have to pay for university fees as well which will place a huge strain on them.,
Depth5_1064,Depth4_744,It will increase the amount of employed people if free university places are given meaning more given back in taxes ,
Depth5_1065,Depth4_744,"But most graduates would be willing to replace fees with a small education tax, say 0.5%, which would achieve the funding needed to make Universities free in the first place.",
Depth5_1066,Depth4_744,By abolishing fees in the long run it will be better for the economy and for it to be consumer driven. Many more people would be able to go through university growing the economy as a whole ,
Depth5_1067,Depth4_744,"This is a long term investment, the funds must be found initially, but then it will pay for itself, with those students paying taxes and contributing to the economy spending their expendable income. ",
Depth5_1068,Depth4_744,There are many developing improving alternatives to University now offering people the opportunity to acquire workplace experince as well as theoritcal knowledge through qualifications such as NVQ3 4 and 5 and the apprenticeship route. This means that many young people will be more inclined to go down this route and less likely to see university and coming out massively in debt as the preferred route. This arguments holds especially true considering the changing nature of the workplace and the types of jobs required in the 2020's where technology is rapidly replacing a lot of the more traditional types of jobs where a university degree signalled an aptitude to perform in that role. Universities need to understand this and recognise that tuition fees are just becoming more of a barrier and not neccasarily providing people with the skills they need to secure well paid jobs afterwards.,y
Depth5_1069,Depth4_750,Those people who want to be doctors or solicitors may have the intelligence but may not have the finances to fund it themselves or from family members.,
Depth5_1070,Depth4_750,"This is true, but they are also essential to our society, particularly doctors, so it seems redundant that only those who can afford to become them do so.",
Depth5_1071,Depth4_750,Not everybody who wants to be a doctor or nurse are able to go through uni as they just don’t have the finances and by allowing the abolishment of fees will increase the number of people within special vocational jobs like a doctor ,
Depth5_1072,Depth4_750,"They may have thought about fees, but not everyone will be willing to take on a large debt, no matter if they feel a drive to follow a particular profession, nor does everyone have parents who will contribute towards their fees. ",
Depth5_1073,Depth4_750,Many more people are now going through the nursing route and going on to become nurse specialists and nurse clinicians that are starting to attract the level of responsibility and improved salary that although not matching doctor's higher end salaries are becoming more competitive and a legitimate career path in that sector without the need to study for 5 years to become a doctor with no income. ,
Depth5_1074,Depth4_766,However the levels of service that they provide the public far outweighs the costs one person could help many in the long run.,
Depth5_1075,Depth4_766,"You're right, these professions shouldn't be singled out, that's why ALL people should be taxed to pay for ALL University courses.",
Depth5_1076,Depth4_766,The government already take taxes and insurance from working people so why should be people like a doctor or nurse have to pay twice when technically they are already giving money back,
Depth5_1077,Depth4_766,"These people have spent years training, the money hasn't be frivolously spent on having fun. We pay people plenty of money in unemployment benefits who give nothing back in the way of taxes. ",
Depth5_1078,Depth4_766,"Because without the years at university in learning so much complex information, skills and theory such as doctor requires they would not be able to perform the job correctly and to the required standard and would endanger lives so they must learn it through university and therefor they are sacrificing a lot of their best young adult years in terms of studying hard and not having much disposable income to learn skills to save lives and therefore should not be penalised later on with paying it back. It is a very different argument though for many degrees like art or history that arguably add little to society",
Depth5_1079,Depth4_774,"They may not be able to get in to university if they have to pay university fees, equal opportunities are given to all i it was made free.",
Depth5_1080,Depth4_774,"This implies talent is an entirely independent factor from other factors, such as poverty, bad schools and families which require care, all factors which would overrule a candidate's talent in deciding whether they can afford university.",
Depth5_1081,Depth4_774,They will have the same chances if they can go through university but if they come from a low income household then how are they going to be able to do this unless we get rid of fees ,
Depth5_1082,Depth4_774,"Scholarships are limited. Even to apply for a place at a university you need money, then you need to be able to access a university. if you don't live in a university town or city, just moving to a new place is impossible for some students from low income families. ",
Depth5_1083,Depth4_774,"it depends on which job roles are being discussed and argued about. Some courses such as doctors and possibly solicitors, other medical roles like physiotherapy and occupational therapy too should have lower fees although they may cost than other non vital courses like arts, music, drama, literature, history courses that are not directly linked to vital careers and there is a big difference in my view between the two",
Depth5_1084,Depth4_794,If they do it that way they benefit from work experience but also receive the education of a university standard ,
Depth5_1085,Depth4_794,"And if both paths are free for the candidate, their choice will be balanced and appropriate for them.",
Depth5_1086,Depth4_794,That’s true but if people aren’t given the chance to go to university because of the fees and a apprenticeship isn’t for them. Then what do they do. And in the wide scheme of it how would that help the economy ,
Depth5_1087,Depth4_794,"It's all about opportunity. While not everyone is academically minded, everyone has some skill or talent that can be developed. Either way, training costs money and all should be able to maximize their potential without being saddled by debt at the end of it. ",
Depth5_1088,Depth4_794,"I agree to some part and would like to see the range of university courses significantly cut to exclude the majority of courses that are not directly linked to critical careers such as doctors, other medical professions, teachers, social workers, solicitors and IT and technology roles that are vital to the economy and life of the country",
Depth5_1089,Depth4_801,"But it wouldn’t encourage people to go for higher paid jobs as they would have to be paying a lot more than anyone else, making I free would eliminate that. ",
Depth5_1090,Depth4_801,"But manageable repayment amounts does not mitigate the fact that one of the main reasons people go to University is to eventually earn more over their careers, not earn less because of a poor jobs market and ever-present debt.",
Depth5_1091,Depth4_801,30k of debt will take many years to clear and will be hanging over the person for many many years adding to their stress in a very highly stressed role such as a doctor. If the fees were to be got rid off in its entirety many more people would be given the chance to chase their dreams,
Depth5_1092,Depth4_801,"That is the reality of it, but do young people think about that when they're confronted with the figures when they're making choices. This is the detail. Does someone at 18 look into this detail or do they just get scared by what appear to be massive sums to a young person. ",
Depth5_1093,Depth4_801,i agree with A1 and many courses are simply a waste of three years and lots of money for many people when an apprenticeship or early introduction to a company would produce better results but for certain degrees i agree that the fees should be significantly lower or removed entirely,
Depth5_1094,Depth4_748,More and more people will be less likely to attend university if the fees continue and the economy will be affected badly,
Depth5_1095,Depth4_748,"The cost to the tax payer would be marginal, the cost of fees for each student, and the burden of having debt ""hanging over them"", is much greater and potentially detrimental to their quality of life and well-being.",
Depth5_1096,Depth4_748,The amount of money paid by each tax payer towards student loans is less than what the students have to pay back monthly.,
Depth5_1097,Depth4_748,"The loan ties them to debt for up to 30 years, the compiling interest on the debt further decreases the likelihood of repayment",
Depth5_1098,Depth4_748,"But their can only be more tax payers if more people work. With abolished fees and consequently no loans to repay, more people will choose to go to universities which in return will have more people in employment generating more tax ",
Depth5_1099,Depth4_751,It will only allow wealthy people to be able to achieve these job roles and less and less working class will be becoming doctors etc,
Depth5_1100,Depth4_751,"All sectors of society need solicitors and doctors. Giving these students these experiences doesn't only benefit the students, but society as a whole.",
Depth5_1101,Depth4_751,"Other countries, such as Scotland, operate a free university system so their solicitors and doctors get that education for free, why couldn’t that work here?",
Depth5_1102,Depth4_751,"Many countries, for example Germany, have free tuition. The level of teaching and the experience gained is on par with the UK system yet this is provided for free. We also have to employ many immigrants in order to provide enough medical care to cover the entire NHS showing that not enough UK nationals are going to university to study medicine.",
Depth5_1103,Depth4_751,"But the fees does deter people from even looking at certain types of occupation which could be leading to skills drainage in the economy. Without fees, people will be open to considering university education ",
Depth5_1104,Depth4_767,If we don’t start giving these professionals some appreciation and motivation to complete their training and continue their jobs we will lose them ,
Depth5_1105,Depth4_767,Children don't have to pay to go to school. Fees also introduce additional pressure. Students sometimes don't know what their best suited to straight away. Making students make a financial commitment at this young age can be stressful and isn't in anyone's interest.,
Depth5_1106,Depth4_767,"They already pay vast amount of taxes as it is when earning a high living, to make them also pay student loans on top of this is excessive.",
Depth5_1107,Depth4_767,"Doctors and nurses provide a vital and lifesaving care to many in need, they often work long hours under high pressure to serve society, it's the least we could do to repay them is remove their debt.",
Depth5_1108,Depth4_767,But The society gives a lot of benefit *free money) to people who choose not to work. So why can't university fees be abolished for those who actually want to further themselves and work which in turn generates taxes for the government ,
Depth5_1109,Depth4_785,But then anyone who cannot afford it is in a negative position and limited to the type of job / career they can get,
Depth5_1110,Depth4_785,"You never know where a degree will take somebody. Forcing students to commit to a certain career path at such a young age isn't helpful. A course that might be seen as ""personal choice"", might later lead to a useful job.",
Depth5_1111,Depth4_785,The individual may not have chosen a career path as yet and could be taking the education option in order to explore their options,
Depth5_1112,Depth4_785,"Often a degree is not ""required"" to perform a certain job, however the competitive nature of the current job market means that many employers will only hire those with the highest credentials even for entry level positions. This is forcing many students hands into higher education to compete.",
Depth5_1113,Depth4_785,But those jobs that don't need a degree are limiting. Most occupational require a university degree. Abolishing the fees will make those career options more desirable ,
Depth5_1114,Depth4_796,There are lots of options for everyone to achieve their desired goal/ career. They will just have to be prepared to pay their loan back,
Depth5_1115,Depth4_796,"University students often work just as hard as those pursuing apprenticeships etc., and their future careers can also be useful to society, so why should they pay but not the others?",
Depth5_1116,Depth4_796,"In some roles you are actually paid to train, such as student paramedics, why should you have to pay to be educated on other courses?",
Depth5_1117,Depth4_796,"Often apprenticeships and other placement schemes are only available for certain sectors, if someone has talents or interests elsewhere then often the only route to this goal is through higher education. ",
Depth5_1118,Depth4_796,But they could be the first in their family that want to go to university amd pursue a certain career and are being deterred due to the high fees. By having access to it for free they could be breaking out a vicious circle they've found themselves in.,
Depth5_1119,Depth4_804,But they will be practically paying their loan back forever and the interest rate is not as low as they make out. ,
Depth5_1120,Depth4_804,"They still have debt ""hanging over them"" and have to worry about paying it off, often at the stage of life when people are trying to save for a house etc.",
Depth5_1121,Depth4_804,If the interest rates are so low is there any real benefit to having charges in the first place?,
Depth5_1122,Depth4_804,"The interest rates aren't the problem, the debt which is gained through education is the problem. This cost of study often puts extra pressure on students, as well as the high costs of living (especially for students who are over charged for often lacking accommodation) means many are priced out of university.",
Depth5_1123,Depth4_804,"But its still interest rate and thus an additional cost on the loan regardless of how low it is. If they can afford to not have the loan at all, the better. ",
Depth5_1124,Depth4_811,"It's not that easy to find a new job, especially one that you personally enjoy, and pays a decent wage.",
Depth5_1125,Depth4_811,No point in having a job they don't enjoy ,
Depth5_1126,Depth4_811,"This is not the case for every one. Some jobs require certain skills or qualifications that not everyone has. Certain companies/jobs require a minimum educational background, which some people do not qualify for, and would not be given the chance to compete for based on their skills. ",
Depth5_1127,Depth4_811,"This is not strictly the case. The bigger picture must be considered, it would not look professional for one to terminate their contract of employment for simply not being happy. Additionally, the financial aspect of such must also be strongly considered, if one is somewhat financially stable in their current job, they may have less inclination for leaving such a job even though they aren't happy. Henceforth, it might not be so much a case of ""having a choice on what they want to do"", rather, what they feel obliged to be doing in the wider scheme of things rather than personal satisfaction. ",
Depth5_1128,Depth4_811,Abolishing university fees would give people greater choice about what jobs they could have by making it more accessible to all.,
Depth5_1129,Depth4_820,"Not everything people pay taxes for is something they're going to use or agree upon. But it goes towards the overall wellbeing of the country, and will help millions of people every day. ",
Depth5_1130,Depth4_820,Taxes are too high in this country,
Depth5_1131,Depth4_820,"Whether or not they care about what tax payers money is going towards is irrelevant, certain things such as the NHS is funded by tax which at some point in our lives we all rely on, regardless of income. ",
Depth5_1132,Depth4_820,"I don't think assuming the prospect of ""much higher taxes"" is well thought, the general cost of such would need to be calculated and a general consensus of opinions gathered. However, given the vast number of those paying taxes within the UK, the difference may only be marginal. Of course, not everyone goes to university and therefore some may be opposed to paying for students to study, however taxes pay to feed our prisoners also, which I personally feel more people would be opposed to. Abolishing university fees by consequence of a marginally higher tax is far outweighed by the benefits of a greater educated population, and allowing those less financially fortunate to study without money worries. ",
Depth5_1133,Depth4_820,You have to look at the bigger picture of what a university education would give those to enable then to contribute more to society.,
Depth5_1134,Depth4_831,"But if we abolish tuition altogether, we're not going to need student loans because everyone will be able to go and do whatever they want to study.",
Depth5_1135,Depth4_831,I believe over half the students r unable to pay the loan back they simply just don't have the money to pay back,
Depth5_1136,Depth4_831,"Often people feel pressured to go to university by schools or parents and end up going and getting into a lifetime of debt just to say they’ve been to university or to gain a qualification they will never use. This stops people who genuinely want to go and study, and dedicate their lives to a certain pathway, as sometimes spaces are taken up in universities by those people that don’t genuinely want to be there to learn. Tuition fees help in a way to put these kinds of people off as often loans aren’t even enough to cover the cost of tuition fees, let alone maintenance costs such as rent and food. ",
Depth5_1137,Depth4_831,"If student loans are infrequently paid back, then maybe the repayment conditions should be observed rather than opposing the prospect of allowing more people to go to university through the scrapping of fees. Education is a right for all, nobody is in any position to deny someone the opportunity to study at university, especially not over the argument of publicly spent money.",
Depth5_1138,Depth4_831,It is very harsh to saddle people with all that debt at the start of their working lives when that education benefits us all in the long run.,
Depth5_1139,Depth4_839,"In theory, that sounds reasonable, but it just doesn't work that way in practice. The more people with university degrees, the more people going up for the same job, the less chance of achieving it.",
Depth5_1140,Depth4_839,Lot of qualified people don't get jobs .,
Depth5_1141,Depth4_839,"There is such a high volume of university students these days that the job market is flooded, employers can pick and choose the best graduate for the job and often graduates are left struggling to find a ‘good job’ despite having the qualifications to do so. ",
Depth5_1142,Depth4_839,"The end goal of university should not primarily be centralised around getting what some may define as a ""good job"". University graduates are at the beginning of their lifelong career, and should not be expected to immediately land a secure well-paying job, immediately following intense education. University should be considered an opportunity to gain critical life skills while studying for a well-respected qualification - which should be a right. Of course, university graduates may appear as better candidates for certain job roles. By allowing more young people to go to university without concerns for finance (i.e. abolishing university fees), more people will be given the opportunity to pursue well-paying careers. ",
Depth5_1143,Depth4_839,It can be harder to get that first job after university for some graduates over those who have been in employment longer so that doesn't necessarily follow.,
Depth5_1144,Depth4_852,"What happens if I never reach that income threshold? That's thousands of pounds the student loan company don't get back because after a set amount of years, it's cleared.",
Depth5_1145,Depth4_852,Still don't agree with loans should be free education ,
Depth5_1146,Depth4_852,If you are unable to find a job paying over the threshold to pay back student loans then you may end up never paying them back. Is this not a waste of time then going to university for 3-5 years to gain a qualification to set you apart and qualify you for higher paying jobs if you end up never earning enough to pay it back or working a lower qualified job? In that case some people would be better off going straight into working life and working their way up through experience rather than through qualifications. ,
Depth5_1147,Depth4_852,"But not everyone may reach a certain income, making it unequal that some graduates will pay for their university education while others won't. An equal system by which graduates are taxed like the rest of the UK population in order to fund university fees for current students makes considerably more sense. ",
Depth5_1148,Depth4_852,It's about giving people that debt in the first place though when it isn't necessary.,
Depth5_1149,Depth4_860,"That certain figure is only slightly above minimum wage, so people are losing almost 1/10th of their income every year to student loans. That's a lot to someone who could be saving up for bigger and better things",
Depth5_1150,Depth4_860,Would be a worry on their mind when they start an adult life .so how can they be happy ,
Depth5_1151,Depth4_860,"But debt is still debt. The point of university is to gain a better chance and more opportunities of a well paid and rewarding career, so people should be expecting to pay this debt off eventually, and at the low rate of 9% means people will more than likely be paying this debt off for the rest of their lives. ",
Depth5_1152,Depth4_860,Earning less makes the prospect of repayment completely unequal - some may be hesitant to pursue certain careers in fear of debt following their graduate tax. ,
Depth5_1153,Depth4_860,It's still a huge amount to have to pay off alongside other bills and at a time when graduates can also be facing other costs such as trying to get on the housing ladder.,

Depth5_1155,Depth4_813,Free University Education would come at a high cost to the tax payer. Not everyone who pays tax would be happy to subsidise free education as it would have no benefit to them. ,
Depth5_1156,Depth4_813,If you are passionate about a certain career path it is your right to be able to follow it,
Depth5_1157,Depth4_813,NAN,
Depth5_1158,Depth4_813,Yes university can be a valuable experience but it should not come at a great financial cost to the individual.,
Depth5_1159,Depth4_821,It is essential to have people educated to a higher education (like doctors) so we should treat it as an essential service. This needs to be based on exam results as we need these people to also be good at what they do. ,
Depth5_1160,Depth4_821,University education is a luxury and free university education is absolutely not an essential service by any means. ,
Depth5_1161,Depth4_821,We all pay taxes so we should be able to access all services whether it be essential or not. We may have to pay slightly more taxes but in the long run it would be worth iy,
Depth5_1162,Depth4_821,"Yes, but if we didn't have to pay for university fees it would make the system fairer, acceptance into university would be based upon academic achievement and not whether you can afford to go or not. ",
Depth5_1163,Depth4_821,"Many people would still choose not to go to university, higher education is not suitable for all people so I do not believe universities would become over subscribed.",
Depth5_1164,Depth4_833,A great deal of people do go to university clueless and leave having very little idea of what they want to do still after completing their course. Letting anyone just get a loan and get a degree is a waste for these people as they leave in debt and with no way of paying it back. ,
Depth5_1165,Depth4_833,"Alot of the time university students just want to bum around instead of getting a job, they take out loans whilst squandering the funds with no intention of paying it back! ",
Depth5_1166,Depth4_833,But alot of people do go to university knowing what they want to do and full intentions of paying back student loans. They have thought long and hard about it,
Depth5_1167,Depth4_833,"But there are a lot of courses that people take which rarely translate into a career path afterwards, just the acquisition of a degree for the sake of having it, without having a clue what path they are going to take afterwards. ",
Depth5_1168,Depth4_833,But there is still so much wrong information being used when talking about university and its fees. A lot of people are not being given accurate information.,
Depth5_1169,Depth4_845,A lot of people that leave university do not end up paying much of their loans back due to having low paying jobs. ,
Depth5_1170,Depth4_845,Free University Education for all will be a complete waste of government resources as many students treat it as a chance to party with hard earned taxpayers money. ,
Depth5_1171,Depth4_845,"There is good jobs out there and what would the country do without highly trained doctors, nurses etc and these people do eventually pay back the loans ",
Depth5_1172,Depth4_845,"Yes but for how long? With less people paying back the fees they are likely to change the rules on repayment, if there was no fees then this would not be a cause for concern. ",
Depth5_1173,Depth4_845,The amount of interest put on student loans is incredibly high and shocks a lot of people.,
Depth5_1174,Depth4_855,If graduates do not earn enough to pay their loan back their loan interest increases and this causes stress and they owe more and more. ,
Depth5_1175,Depth4_855,For free education for all to take place the rise in taxes will be crippling to the tax payer. ,
Depth5_1176,Depth4_855,At the end of the day these students have to work all the way through university the loans that they receive doesnt keep them. When they leave uni and may not get a job immediatly they often have to work in a low paid job just to make ends meat,y
Depth5_1177,Depth4_855,"Yes but this has been time wasted and debt that has then been incurred for nothing, if there was no fees then at least the lack of a job doesn't also have the added stress of a large amount of debt hanging over you. ",
Depth5_1178,Depth4_855,But that shows that a university degree is not giving people what they need to get the 'good' job it promises.,
Depth5_1179,Depth4_862,People should not be punished with an extra tax for choosing to go in to a job that requires higher education. Other things like apprenticeships or courses in college do not work like this.,
Depth5_1180,Depth4_862,I totally agree that students should sign an agreement to pay back the money by a reasonable time frame and this money put back into our society. ,
Depth5_1181,Depth4_862,It is one thing to have debt because of borrowing for items etc but to have large debts for education isnt fair as we need people to do these specialist jobs,
Depth5_1182,Depth4_862,"Going to university should not be a right reserved for only those who have the financial backing for example from their parents to fund them, if there were no fees it would mean a fairer system for all where entry to university is based upon how much academic work you put in to secure a place. ",
Depth5_1183,Depth4_862,The system is so complicated and flawed that you cannot expect people to understand. If it were free people would not be overloaded with information.,
Depth5_1184,Depth4_814,But having the choice to go to university to get ahead in employment without getting into thousands of pounds of debt should be a right. ,
Depth5_1185,Depth4_814,Many people don't like being in debt and may feel pressured to search for higher paying jobs to pay off their loan.,
Depth5_1186,Depth4_814,"STEM fields are not the only important fields, and many individuals do not want to get into them, despite having talent on other areas.",
Depth5_1187,Depth4_814,But they will never pay their loans off. The loans will act as an extra tax until they die. This doesn’t make university a favourable option to some people,
Depth5_1188,Depth4_814,"Everyone should have the option to go to university, which is not always possible if a family is not on good income. While the tuition fees are paid initially, some parents may encourage their children to work instead of study after age 19 in order to help with paying bills. If fees did not have to be paid back, this might happen less.",
Depth5_1189,Depth4_814,The loans take years to pay off and usually a person will not get a job straight after graduating so it will take them a very long time to pay this loan off ,
Depth5_1190,Depth4_824,"There are many services we have to pay for that not everyone uses, university should just be another one! ",
Depth5_1191,Depth4_824,Other countries are able to provide their students with free education. We should give the young people most opportunities to get the best out of them.,
Depth5_1192,Depth4_824,Everyone who graduates university will eventually fall into higher paying jobs thanks to their education and will be paying more in taxes so will eventually pay back the fees without loans.,
Depth5_1193,Depth4_824,University fees are not the same as taxes. The university takes the fees as profit and it does not go into services like the police. Student loans have increased dramatically and now are much too high ,
Depth5_1194,Depth4_824,"It could be argued that children from families who pay tax are more entitled to university education, especially those whose parents have always worked and paid taxes.",
Depth5_1195,Depth4_824,"A child does not have to pay taxes when going to school because they are not financially stable. In the same way, at the age of 18 most young adults do not have the money to pay £9k per year plus living expenses and accomodation. Should these people also not be covered by taxes? And when they graduate start paying taxes and help the next generation study at university?",y
Depth5_1196,Depth4_835,If universities were only able to teach courses that were sensible and led to employment then it would be better. ,
Depth5_1197,Depth4_835,"A lot can still be learned at university, even if students have no idea where they are going. It's also a place for people to mature and learn to manage themselves.",
Depth5_1198,Depth4_835,But many more who are currently put off from university due to the cost will go knowing what they can achieve. This will allow universities to select their attendees that are most suited to the courses on offer.,
Depth5_1199,Depth4_835,"University would not seem out of reach for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Plus, universities could become stricter with their administration process if it wasn’t all a money making scheme ",
Depth5_1200,Depth4_835,"Free university education might encourage people to think more about what they want to study, the may consider going to university at a later age instead of worrying about fees going up and taking as low fees as possible while they can. This might result in more mature students attending university and putting their degree to good use.",
Depth5_1201,Depth4_835,This is correct however by going to university they are acquiring skills of a competent worker. Even though they have no idea where they are going they can still use this degree to help get a job and boost out economy,
Depth5_1202,Depth4_848,But it does increase your prospects to progress further once you are in employment. ,
Depth5_1203,Depth4_848,Students must pay extortionate fees only to be faced with the daunting prospect of landing a decent paying job. It doesnt sound fair to me.,
Depth5_1204,Depth4_848,NAN,

Depth5_1217,Depth4_866,"The idea of having a fee as just a way to make students value education is silly. The loans provided for university are often not seen as real debt, but a necessity in order to better themselves and reach their goals. Why add an extra unnecessary burden?",
Depth5_1218,Depth4_866,"Since graduates are not required to pay back fees until they are earning above a certain threshold, they may consider purposely keeping themselves below the threshold in order to avoid fees being paid back all together. This may put further strain on tax payers, if taxes go up in order to accommodate the lack of repayments.",
Depth5_1219,Depth4_866,Fees is a major deterrent for why young people do not go university. The thought of the £9k itself along with all resources and living costs is very daunting. We should not put a price on a good education because education is more important than money. Putting money first will lead to ignorance in our society and a great loss in the economy ,
Depth5_1220,Depth4_872,Fees should be abolished as to give the poorest students get some qualification. Which would help them to get a well payed job ,
Depth5_1221,Depth4_872,"Yes but if a post-graduate is just over the threshold, they will automatically have to start paying back which will lower their household income. It would be more beneficial to get a job with a salary just under the threshold so you don't start paying it back.",

Depth5_1231,Depth4_902,Students often need to work unsociable hours (at clubs and bars for example) as these are the most readily available jobs for them. This fatigue and working can lead to even the brightest of students starting to fail and struggle. ,
Depth5_1232,Depth4_902,Hours of studying and working do not directly represent intelligence.

It will never be a level playing field, but abolishing loans will make it more so then it is presently.",

Depth5_1598,Depth4_35,"This assumes that the person is going to be able to pay back the loan, which is not always the case. People from low income families who take out loans could easily end up defaulting on them if they can't find steady employment adter studying.",y
Depth5_1599,Depth4_35,Yes but the problem is that loans do not always cover all of the student's costs. For example for some they do not cover rent whereas for some people they have money left over which is not fair.,
Depth5_1600,Depth4_35,"But there is no guarantee that in the future, this won’t change. ",
Depth5_1601,Depth4_35,"Having a large loan to pay back will put young people off going to university, as they will see paying it back as a shadow over their adult life.",
Depth5_1602,Depth4_35,"The loan is however significantly higher than the minimum payment required to clear it. In most cases students either never fully repay there loan, or spend 20 years chipping away at it. ",
Depth5_1603,Depth4_79,"If the job market is extremely competitive, some people with degrees are still going to fall through the cracks and find it difficult to pay back their loans.",
Depth5_1604,Depth4_79,Therefore every body should have a chance at this opportunity so fees should be scrapped otherwise the same people will have this advantage for most jobs.,
Depth5_1605,Depth4_79,It doesn’t give you an advantage for MOST jobs as the post grad market Is overcrowded. People end up being over qualified for the jobs available.,
Depth5_1606,Depth4_79,"A lot of jobs will see a graduate as being overqualified and likely to leave for a better job after a short time, or because they are bored, and are therefore not worth taking on and training.",
Depth5_1607,Depth4_79,So many people now have degrees that the market for employees is saturated with degree qualified workers.,
Depth5_1608,Depth4_1146,"The fact of taking out a loan still burdens these students and gives them more to worry about, which might impact their studies. It's also just blatantly unfair.",
Depth5_1609,Depth4_1146,Students still have financial burden though and it is most likely that they will earn a reasonable wage so they cannot escape the loan.,
Depth5_1610,Depth4_1146,"Once they earn a “reasonable” wage, what about the cost of living? Repayments could put the person back on the poverty line. This loan becomes a burden",
Depth5_1611,Depth4_1146,"It is still a financial burden, and will make it even harder for young people to get on the housing ladder.",
Depth5_1612,Depth4_1146,"But then in most cases the loan is either not paid off, or the student never truly fulfills there potential and takes a job below the ""reasonable loan"". ",
Depth5_1613,Depth4_1154,"This creates an uneven playing field, and in any case, assumes people feel in a position to even make the choice to pay for their education in the first place. People from low-income families will not see it as an option as it makes the whole system of higher education look like it's designed for people who are not like them.",
Depth5_1614,Depth4_1154,Realistically not everyone has funds to pay for education so it is unfair to expect people to pay. People from all socioeconomic backgrounds should be able to go to uni if they want to but many from low socioeconomic backgrounds are missing out because they cannot afford it. ,
Depth5_1615,Depth4_1154,"Education should never be restricted to the privileged. In the interest of inclusivity, low income students who want to learn should be able to go to university.

Depth5_1617,Depth4_1154,The loan system does to a degree allow for you to earn your education. The government are simply offsetting the cost so it can be spread over your working life as long as you earn enough. ,
Depth5_1618,Depth4_1162,"Just because you are not paying anything back at present doesn't negate the fact you end up owing more and more interest, effectively getting punished for not paying it back sooner.",
Depth5_1619,Depth4_1162,NAN,
Depth5_1620,Depth4_1162,"The debt still exists and it still accrues interest. When getting a new job, the threshold again may cause issues when it comes to affording repayments. The cost of living is too high to afford loan repayments, no matter how reasonable the interest may be.",
Depth5_1621,Depth4_1162,"The loan will be a cloud on the horizon, even if they do not yet have to pay it back.",
Depth5_1622,Depth4_1162,The loan eventually is nullified after a certain amount of time. It also does not go towards your credit score so has no bearing regardless of whether you owe £4 or £90k. ,
Depth5_1623,Depth4_1170,"This is simply not the case for many people - a ""basic income"" will be unevenly distributed. What if you live in an area with high rent and high food prices? You also have ignored the point about interest rates.",
Depth5_1624,Depth4_1170,Not necessarily as living costs are high so for some the amount they pay may make a huge difference.,
Depth5_1625,Depth4_1170,"If you’re on a basic income, you don’t have a small percentage left for a loan. You need to be physically and mentally healthy if you’re working and being pushed into extra hardship decreases motivation ",
Depth5_1626,Depth4_1170,"The cost of living is higher now than in the past due to extremely high housing costs, so even a small percentage will hurt.",
Depth5_1627,Depth4_1170,Is it however fair for someone to train for so long and then pay back money for the training when only earning the same as an unqualified worker? ,
Depth5_1628,Depth4_84,An employer will favour someone with a degree and experience over someone who just has work experience. Degrees often include work placements and projects involving contacts within the industry. Those contacts can be useful in obtaining work at the end of the degree. ,
Depth5_1629,Depth4_84,People with a degree would be a faster and more competent option for most employers as they would save costs from training,
Depth5_1630,Depth4_84,"but uni provides many opportunities to improve and learn for caress, such a career placement, interview practice and strength days.",
Depth5_1631,Depth4_84,Much work experience nowadays requires you to be studying in the field of industry relevant to the placement. Acquiring work placements without the relevant studies is only really feasible if one has personal connections to those already working within the industry they are interested in.,
Depth5_1632,Depth4_84,I think University is highly appreciated by employers and helps people become more independent but it's not fair that people have financial stress lurking above them whilst studying as it would be harder to learn and stops people from pursuing thier dream careers. ,
Depth5_1633,Depth4_116,It's still unobtainable for candidates from poorer backgrounds. Without university fees it'll make career progression more obtainable no matter what background you're from. ,
Depth5_1634,Depth4_116,People with great potential might be put off to succeed and later be an great asset due to scary loans and fees,
Depth5_1635,Depth4_116,"but a loan means they will be worse of in the future as have interest on the loan, so unfair as actually pay more than a richer person that can pay it straight away",
Depth5_1636,Depth4_116,Acquiring financial support is a difficult process. The implication that if one has talent but not the financial means to attend university then justice will enact itself and present them with a scholarship is fantasy. The issue at hand is that an degree can effectively be bought and not earned purely on academic merit.,
Depth5_1637,Depth4_116,Even if some people can get a loan it usually has to be paid back so again that financial stress is always there.,
Depth5_1638,Depth4_1147,"Most degrees involve a lot of self study, if a person has to take on a job to pay for their university fees, they won't be putting everything they've got into their degree and they'll simply be too tired from working. ",

Depth5_1640,Depth4_1147,"working alongside it may make them burn out before the end of studies meaning no degree but still a loan to have to pay back or means they don't get as high a degree, effecting the career path later on",
Depth5_1641,Depth4_1147,"Working alongside study puts the lower income student at a disadvantage. Many students work whilst studying for a bit of extra money for recreational use, but the implication that if a low income student chooses to continue their education at university then they must slog to make ends meet by working alongside their studies is not only unfair, it is also discriminatory.",
Depth5_1642,Depth4_1147,If people start working alongside university it would just add more stress to thier lives as University is demanding enough. We need to think of people's sanity here in order for them to get the best grades they need to have rests aswell. ,y
Depth5_1643,Depth4_1155,"Loans can cause debt issues, if the person were unable to obtain work straight after university they won't be able to afford to pay back loan repayments ",
Depth5_1644,Depth4_1155,Loans are scary and often you are pestered by second hand companies about the loan,
Depth5_1645,Depth4_1155,9k arguably very steep for some courses with small contact hours and little resources needed to be provided by the uni,
Depth5_1646,Depth4_1155,The repayable nature from Student Loans Company is not the primary issue. The issue is that low income students struggle to meet their essential costs even with the loans given to them. The redundancy of grants has meant that many students are going without extra funds needed for a good quality of life whilst studying as opposed to being financially punished for wanting to better their education.,
Depth5_1647,Depth4_1155,NAN,

Depth5_1653,Depth4_1174,Many university graduates will make sure they get a job under £21000 to avoid paying the fees back until the debt is abolished. You may as well abolish the fees if this is the case,
Depth5_1654,Depth4_1174,The struggle of finical pressure of having to pay back the loan so soon after even finding a basic job could stop people from getting a job in a sector they have studied for because of money issues ,

Depth5_1657,Depth4_1174,NAN,
Depth5_1658,Depth4_88,A degree has an element of work placement involved and so the student has 'work experience' built in and can use the skills to their advantage in the interview process.,
Depth5_1659,Depth4_88,"I strongly disagree with that statement, if a person is able to complete a university degree the total cost to them as an individual is actually potentially lower, for example they have better chances to enter into employment at a higher pay grade therefore better pension options, a better standard of living, if they weren’t able to complete a degree because they couldn’t afford the fees or fear of being in debt they are much more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status and poorer standard of living both on a monetary level and a general health and welfare level.",
Depth5_1660,Depth4_88,A few years studying for a degree is nothing in the grand scheme of things. The qualification will put you at an advantage for gaining a job compared to an individual who had no degree and just experience. ,
Depth5_1661,Depth4_88,A lot of degrees offer placements so the person has job experience and specialist academic knowledge. A person with a degree will understand the work ethics more than someone new to the industry. ,
Depth5_1662,Depth4_88,NAN,
Depth5_1663,Depth4_138,"Providing the degree and education is delivered and monitored correctly whilst the student is at university then the student will continue with their desire to complete their education without ""slacking off""",
Depth5_1664,Depth4_138,"The value to their degree would be the amount of effort they put in and the grade they achieve, certainly not how much it cost the, or how much debt they find themselves in. If someone is committed to completing a degree they should be able to access it on a financially viable basis both for the individual and the economy.",
Depth5_1665,Depth4_138,The majority of individuals who have achieved a degree struggle to pay off their finances as fees are ridiculously expensive so because of this individuals will not perceive paying their fees as an objective to accomplish ,
Depth5_1666,Depth4_138,"Going to university is still a personal choice. If someone wants a degree, they will put in the work and earn the ethics if it's costing them or not. ",
Depth5_1667,Depth4_138,"Having high fees will often put off students from working class backgrounds. They may be high in intelligence and have a good work ethic, but often the debt seems so enormous that they do not feel they can take it on. Having high fees only disadvantages those from poorer backgrounds, not those with poorer work ethics. ",
Depth5_1668,Depth4_226,"Given the current state of our economy in this country then I believe it would be more beneficial to abolish the fees, allow the qualified to earn the same as their peers and allow them to spend that money back into our economy rather than let it contribute to the national debt",
Depth5_1669,Depth4_226,"Most of the debt is never completely paid back it is written off, therefore that argument holds no water as so many former students never achieve the payment threshold to repay the debt in full in the allotted time.",
Depth5_1670,Depth4_226,"In the past, it wasn't that getting into university was harder, but rather the fact that going to university was not a common thing",
Depth5_1671,Depth4_226,"People with debt are more likely to depend on the economy for hangouts, in turn are unable to place it into the economy. Those with no student debt will have 100% of income to boost the economy ",
Depth5_1672,Depth4_226,"Our society has become much broader and more accepting of different groups of people. More people are feeling confidence in their abilities to apply, and thus are being accepted. It's still an investment, it's just a more frequent investment than it was in the past. ",
Depth5_1673,Depth4_1153,And again the loans and grants have to be repaid which accumulate the amount of debt.,
Depth5_1674,Depth4_1153,"Loans are exactly that, loans which get students into debt because they can not afford it. We are potentially losing out on some great minds doing well in out most needed fields such as science and medicine because the cost and debt they would find themselves in is off putting.",
Depth5_1675,Depth4_1153,The thought of having to apply and receive loans will put a lot of people off applying for university,
Depth5_1676,Depth4_1153,But loans give a person less income in the long term. It reflects badly on people and can be a deterrent to people attending university. ,
Depth5_1677,Depth4_1153,"The loans often don't cover the full rent payment, and additional grants often don't provide enough money for a student to live on for the whole term. This may force them into getting a second job and taking away from their studies, or may cause them to not take care of themselves properly due to a fear of running out of money. ",
Depth5_1678,Depth4_1165,"But the whole reason behind obtaining that level of education is so you can achieve the higher wage bracket which means the loan has to be paid back, and if the system works as it was intended then that debt is being paid off as soon as the student finds that first position of employment.",
Depth5_1679,Depth4_1165,"Yes however some will reach that level over a longer period of time having obtained the relevant degree in their chosen field, and if it takes them to long to achieve their chosen job they are in even more debt than they would have been which will put them off of following through on the degree, and the degrees will lose their value some may just opt to pursue a degree for the sake of saying they have a degree without ever pursue a career in their field of choice.",
Depth5_1680,Depth4_1165,"So as the loans are rarely fully paid off, there is no point in having to pay it in the first place",
Depth5_1681,Depth4_1165,That goes singles out graduates who do achieve the income level. They spend their lives paying a student loan and only achieve paying the interest. ,
Depth5_1682,Depth4_1165,But we shouldn't put a pressure on students who have worked hard to get a good job to then stay below a certain income level as they don't wish to pay off their debts. They should be encouraged to aim for the highly paid jobs without worrying about their student loan.,
Depth5_1683,Depth4_1179,"And so the debt will be hanging over the student from the word go, which could set them back from the offset especially with the pressure.",
Depth5_1684,Depth4_1179,This will mean they will not actually be receiving that higher pay as it will go back into repaying their student loan. They could as easily go for a lower paid job outside their relevant degree just to avoid repaying the debt.,
Depth5_1685,Depth4_1179,It appears to be unfair as some individuals (higher earning jobs) will have to pay a large amount off whereas other individuals (below the threshold) may have obtained a free education,
Depth5_1686,Depth4_1179,Not if they're paying the interest. ,
Depth5_1687,Depth4_1179,"That's not always the case. The wage and income level of different jobs can vary no matter what the skill, so the money may not always come back through the current loan system.",
Depth5_1688,Depth4_418,But how is an individual supposed to move forward with limited job prospects and that amount of debt hanging over their heads! The loans take a significant amount of time to pay back when the student is already mid twenties and looking to build a future.,
Depth5_1689,Depth4_418,"But even in that situation you are still paying back money even though your degree hasn't started to benefit you, which is unfair",
Depth5_1690,Depth4_418,having a long-term financial burden such as paying back student loans can affect mental health and prevent progression. Small interest rates will quickly add up if your loan is £36K andit's taking you 30 years to repay.,
Depth5_1691,Depth4_418,The debt is still there even if it's paid with smaller interest and debt can be burdensome to individual,
Depth5_1692,Depth4_418,"But the interest builds up over time so even though it may not impact the individual straight away, it has an impact over the course of the persons life as interest adds up even if the person isn’t in a job or earning a high wage. If someone has worked hard and earned a degree they shouldn’t have to worry about paying it off for the rest of their life.",
Depth5_1693,Depth4_576,There is already a significant 'cost of living' that needs to be met before any student loans are considered and if a student is to excel in their universtiy education and devote those years to doing this then realistically they don't have enough spare time to earn enough money to cover these costs. ,
Depth5_1694,Depth4_576,"The reality is that students shouldn't be forced to work along side studies, but many are as they can not afford to live from their loan on its own",
Depth5_1695,Depth4_576,"Making friends and having a healthy social life is part of the experience, and no one should be made to feel guilty for enjoying that aspect. I think however, what you've described is a minority, and people who take their education seriously don't do that. In some degrees, the contact hours are very long (e.g. the sciences), and getting a part-time job simply isn't feasible. Besides, no minimum wage bar tending gig will even begin to cover your tuition fees! It might just alleviate some pressure off your living costs. ",
Depth5_1696,Depth4_576,Getting a part time job whilst studying can take a toll on students especially when there's are loads of course work and studying to do. Student hardly gets free time to party. Weekend partying is a way to relax from all the intense studying,
Depth5_1697,Depth4_576,"We might have many intelligent people prepared to study hard and become scientists, surgeons, lecturers, but they may not be able to afford to go to university. Currently it seems the wrong type of person may be taking advantage of the system because their parents are well off and they can get into university but not be smart or willing to learn.",
Depth5_1698,Depth4_707,But at some point in their early career they're faced with this massive 9k debt and it is literally hanging over them with the pressure of having to pay it back eventually.,
Depth5_1699,Depth4_707,In what world is 9k worth of debt not putting people off?,
Depth5_1700,Depth4_707,"The 9K fee covers almost all degree subjects, and although in some sectors you may find it easy to get a job and quickly pay the loan back, in others the job market is totally saturated and doesn't pay well, so that 9K will take a really long time to repay and stunt your financial freedom for a long time.",
Depth5_1701,Depth4_707,"Regardless of how the debt is paid back, it's not good to be in debt. Going in debt to study makes an individual worst off even before starting a job. Getting a job is not even guaranteed and by the time a graduate secures a job, the debt is the first that comes to mind",
Depth5_1702,Depth4_707,Debt it debt and maybe some people would rather not get into debt for education. The current level of repayment is so low and the interest is high this means people on lower wages don’t have a chance at paying it off and will be getting deductions for the rest of their career.,
Depth5_1703,Depth4_966,But why shouldn't the under privileged be entitled to the same opportunities in the wider field and be able to educate themselves to the same levels and open up those opportunities for themselves?,
Depth5_1704,Depth4_966,"9k per year is a lot to pay for a ""better chance"". Its still not a certainty",
Depth5_1705,Depth4_966,The poorest people will still be put off attending though so will not have the benefit of a degree in their career,
Depth5_1706,Depth4_966,I know so many students who didn't get a job with what they studied and this alone is frustrating plus remembering that there is debt to be paid. So it does no pay off well for some people in the long run,
Depth5_1707,Depth4_966,"I think the fees do stop certain people going to university and it’s a shame, education should be available to everyone.",
Depth5_1708,Depth4_1067,If the government wants our country to suceed given the current state of Brexit then they should set aside the funding to invest in our educations which will feed into our industries giving us the upper hand across europe.,y

Depth5_1710,Depth4_1067,"It isn't an equal opportunity though, as some people will not be able to afford to attend ",
Depth5_1711,Depth4_1067,I doubt level of education will drop because not everyone is interested in going to university. Education should still be accessible to those who are interested and made at a price that's affordable,
Depth5_1712,Depth4_1067,"Cutting fees doesn’t impact the entry criteria, they will still have to apply to get into university and universities will still have standards to uphold, this should not be impacted by fees.",
Depth5_1713,Depth4_1181,That would only benefit a certain class of people rather than a wider field.,
Depth5_1714,Depth4_1181,"Both of these statements are true, so why not take the option that scraps fees?",
Depth5_1715,Depth4_1181,NAN,
Depth5_1716,Depth4_1181,Some jobs after higher education don't pay enough compared to what jobs with skill set pays. This does not encourage the younger generation who are trying to make decisions of whether or not to go to university,
Depth5_1717,Depth4_1181,"Putting the cost in taxes means the money is spread across many people and therefore it will have a much smaller impact on people but everyone will benefit from people graduating and becoming lawyers, surgeons, teachers.",
Depth5_1718,Depth4_797,Government had the responsibility to cap a price how much they can charge so that the majority can go to university ,
Depth5_1719,Depth4_797,"You shouldn’t have to pay for university as you are going to help with the economy getting a job through education. If you choose an apprenticeship you get paid, you don’t pay for it, so uni should be the same.",
Depth5_1720,Depth4_797,"Higher education such as university should be free for all individuals. Higher education is needed for very much needed and important job roles such as nursing, doctors, teaching and these jobs are very important in society which is why university fees should be free. More people would go into these types of jobs, if the training for them such as university was to be free and that is why I think university fees should be abolished.",
Depth5_1721,Depth4_797,"A better educated populace is better for everyone, so an increase in taxes (which wouldn't happen just for education anyway) would benefit more than those receiving the education. ",
Depth5_1722,Depth4_797,but providing higher education to younger people will benefit the country greater on long term allowing greater taxes from wages thus providing a more efficient and better off workforce,
Depth5_1723,Depth4_967,I think a means test system is necessary to find out who has highest chance of getting a degree at the end of the course,
Depth5_1724,Depth4_967,"There are many people who can’t afford to go to uni, people from poorer backgrounds should be given the opportunity to higher education. People who have children, people who have no family to help with costs. Why should people miss out because of the expense of fees. ",
Depth5_1725,Depth4_967,Every person should have the right to free higher education in order to improve their life and career prospects. If these people had the free higher education to succeed then there would be more people in job roles which we need.,

Depth5_1729,Depth4_1157,"The loan is only a temporary solution and has to be paid back eventually, not everyone can afford this and will end up in too much debt. Loans are also not a fair, equal way as they go on your parents earnings too and that varies from family to family. Even though this makes no difference to the person actually attending uni. ",
Depth5_1730,Depth4_1157,"The loan system doesn't take into consideration the interest on the loan after you have completed university. Also, usually the loan isn't enough to support the individual with their higher education and therefore that individual has to work alongside studying at university.",
